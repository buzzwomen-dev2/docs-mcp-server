## Django Forum

Django has an [official Forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com) where you can input and ask questions.

There are several categories of discussion including:

* [Using Django](https://forum.djangoproject.com/c/users/6): to ask any question regarding the installation, usage, or
  debugging of Django.
* [Internals](https://forum.djangoproject.com/c/internals/5): for discussion of the development of Django itself.

#### NOTE
Before asking a question about how to contribute, read
[Contributing to Django](contributing/index.md). Many frequently asked questions are
answered there.

In addition, Django has several official mailing lists on Google Groups that
are open to anyone.
