# Contributing code

So you’d like to write some code, documentation or tests to improve Django?
There are several ways you can help Django’s development.

## Tutorials

The Django tutorial contains a whole section that walks you step-by-step
through the contributing code process.

* [Writing your first contribution for Django](../../../intro/contributing.md)

## How-to guides

If you already have some familiarity with the processes and principles,
our documentation also contains useful guidance on specific topics:

* [How to submit a patch to Django for new and/or fixed behavior](submitting-patches.md)
* [How to write and run tests](../../../topics/testing/overview.md)
* [How to run Django's unit tests](unit-tests.md)
* [How to work with Git and GitHub](working-with-git.md)
