# Contributing to Django

Django is a community that lives on its volunteers. As it keeps growing, we
always need more people to help others. You can contribute in many ways, either
on the framework itself or in the wider ecosystem.

## Communication channels

We’re passionate about helping Django users make the jump to contributing
members of the community. Communication is key - working on Django is being
part of a conversation. Join it, to become familiar with what we’re doing and
how we talk about it. You’ll be able to form relationships with more
experienced contributors who are there to help guide you towards success.

### Join the Django community

There are several ways you can help the Django community and others to maintain
a great ecosystem to work in:

* Join the [Django Forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com/). This forum is a place for discussing the Django
  framework and applications and projects that use it. This is also a good
  place to ask and answer any questions related to installing, using, or
  contributing to Django.
* Join the [Django Discord server](https://chat.djangoproject.com) to discuss and answer questions. By
  explaining Django to other users, you’re going to learn a lot about the
  framework yourself.
* Blog about Django. We syndicate all the Django blogs we know about on
  the [community page](https://www.djangoproject.com/community/); if you’d like to see your blog on that page you
  can [register it here](https://www.djangoproject.com/community/add/blogs/).
* Contribute to open-source Django projects, write some documentation, or
  release your own code as an open-source pluggable application. The
  ecosystem of pluggable applications is a big strength of Django, help us
  build it!

## Getting started

Django encourages and welcomes new contributors, and makes an effort to help
them become experienced, confident contributors to Open Source Software (OSS).
Our documentation contains guidance for first-time contributors, including:

* [An overview of the contributing process and what's involved.](new-contributors.md)

## Work on the Django framework

If you enjoy working *with* Django, wait until you start working *on* it.
Really, **anyone** can do something to improve Django, which will improve the
experience of lots of people!

The work on Django itself falls into three major areas:

### Contributing code

Fix a bug, or add a new feature. You can make a pull request and see **your
code** in the next version of Django.

* [Contributing code](writing-code/index.md)
  * [Tutorials](writing-code/index.md#tutorials)
  * [How-to guides](writing-code/index.md#how-to-guides)
  * [Related topics](writing-code/index.md#related-topics)

### Contributing documentation

Django’s documentation is one of its key strengths. It’s informative and
thorough. You can help to improve the documentation and keep it relevant as the
framework evolves.

* [Writing documentation](writing-documentation.md)
  * [The Django documentation process](writing-documentation.md#the-django-documentation-process)
  * [How the documentation is organized](writing-documentation.md#how-the-documentation-is-organized)
  * [How to start contributing documentation](writing-documentation.md#how-to-start-contributing-documentation)
  * [Writing style](writing-documentation.md#writing-style)
  * [Commonly used terms](writing-documentation.md#commonly-used-terms)
  * [Django-specific terminology](writing-documentation.md#django-specific-terminology)
  * [Guidelines for reStructuredText files](writing-documentation.md#guidelines-for-restructuredtext-files)
  * [Django-specific markup](writing-documentation.md#django-specific-markup)
  * [Documenting new features](writing-documentation.md#documenting-new-features)
  * [Minimizing images](writing-documentation.md#minimizing-images)
  * [An example](writing-documentation.md#an-example)
  * [Translating documentation](writing-documentation.md#translating-documentation)
  * [`django-admin` man page](writing-documentation.md#django-admin-man-page)

### Localizing Django

Django is translated into over 100 languages - There’s even some translation
for Klingon?! The i18n team is always looking for translators to help maintain
and increase language reach.

* [Localizing Django](localizing.md)
  * [Translations](localizing.md#translations)
  * [Formats](localizing.md#formats)
  * [Documentation](localizing.md#documentation)

## Other ways of contributing

Explore additional avenues of contributing to Django beyond coding. Django’s
[ticket tracker](https://code.djangoproject.com/) is the central hub for managing issues, improvements, and
contributions to Django. It’s a valuable resource where you can report bugs you
encounter or assist in triaging existing tickets to ensure a smooth development
workflow.

Django also has a [process for suggesting ideas](bugs-and-features.md#requesting-features)
where you can join the community in discussing ideas for new features. Beyond
the Django codebase, there’s a [vibrant ecosystem](https://www.djangoproject.com/community/ecosystem/) that is maintained by the
community that you can contribute to.

better for everyone.
