# The Django admin site

One of the most powerful parts of Django is the automatic admin interface. It
reads metadata from your models to provide a quick, model-centric interface
where trusted users can manage content on your site. The admin’s recommended
use is limited to an organization’s internal management tool. It’s not intended
for building your entire front end around.

The admin has many hooks for customization, but beware of trying to use those
hooks exclusively. If you need to provide a more process-centric interface
that abstracts away the implementation details of database tables and fields,
then it’s probably time to write your own views.

In this document we discuss how to activate, use, and customize Django’s admin
interface.

## Overview

The admin is enabled in the default project template used by
[`startproject`](../../django-admin.md#django-admin-startproject).

If you’re not using the default project template, here are the requirements:

1. Add `'django.contrib.admin'` and its dependencies -
   [`django.contrib.auth`](../../../topics/auth/index.md#module-django.contrib.auth), [`django.contrib.contenttypes`](../contenttypes.md#module-django.contrib.contenttypes),
   [`django.contrib.messages`](../messages.md#module-django.contrib.messages), and [`django.contrib.sessions`](../../../topics/http/sessions.md#module-django.contrib.sessions) - to your
   [`INSTALLED_APPS`](../../settings.md#std-setting-INSTALLED_APPS) setting.
2. Configure a [`DjangoTemplates`](../../../topics/templates.md#django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates)
   backend in your [`TEMPLATES`](../../settings.md#std-setting-TEMPLATES) setting with
   `django.template.context_processors.request`,
   `django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth`, and
   `django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages` in
   the `'context_processors'` option of [`OPTIONS`](../../settings.md#std-setting-TEMPLATES-OPTIONS).
3. If you’ve customized the [`MIDDLEWARE`](../../settings.md#std-setting-MIDDLEWARE) setting,
   [`django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware`](../../middleware.md#django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware),
   [`django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware`](../../middleware.md#django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware), and
   [`django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware`](../../middleware.md#django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware) must be
   included.
4. [Hook the admin’s URLs into your URLconf](#hooking-adminsite-to-urlconf).

After you’ve taken these steps, you’ll be able to use the admin site by
visiting the URL you hooked it into (`/admin/`, by default).

If you need to create a user to login with, use the [`createsuperuser`](../../django-admin.md#django-admin-createsuperuser)
command. By default, logging in to the admin requires that the user has the
[`is_staff`](../auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.is_staff) attribute set to `True`.

Finally, determine which of your application’s models should be editable in the
admin interface. For each of those models, register them with the admin as
described in [`ModelAdmin`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin).

## `ModelAdmin` objects

### *class* ModelAdmin

The `ModelAdmin` class is the representation of a model in the admin
interface. Usually, these are stored in a file named `admin.py` in your
application. Let’s take a look at an example of the `ModelAdmin`:

```default
from django.contrib import admin
from myapp.models import Author


class AuthorAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    pass


admin.site.register(Author, AuthorAdmin)
```

### The `register` decorator

### register(\*models, site=django.contrib.admin.sites.site)

There is also a decorator for registering your `ModelAdmin` classes:

```default
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Author


@admin.register(Author)
class AuthorAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    pass
```

It’s given one or more model classes to register with the `ModelAdmin`.
If you’re using a custom [`AdminSite`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite), pass it using the `site`
keyword argument:

```default
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Author, Editor, Reader
from myproject.admin_site import custom_admin_site


@admin.register(Author, Reader, Editor, site=custom_admin_site)
class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    pass
```

You can’t use this decorator if you have to reference your model admin
class in its `__init__()` method, e.g.
`super(PersonAdmin, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)`. You can use
`super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)`.

### Discovery of admin files

When you put `'django.contrib.admin'` in your [`INSTALLED_APPS`](../../settings.md#std-setting-INSTALLED_APPS)
setting, Django automatically looks for an `admin` module in each
application and imports it.

#### *class* apps.AdminConfig

This is the default [`AppConfig`](../../applications.md#django.apps.AppConfig) class for the admin.
It calls [`autodiscover()`](#django.contrib.admin.autodiscover) when Django starts.

#### *class* apps.SimpleAdminConfig

This class works like [`AdminConfig`](#django.contrib.admin.apps.AdminConfig),
except it doesn’t call [`autodiscover()`](#django.contrib.admin.autodiscover).

#### default_site

A dotted import path to the default admin site’s class or to a callable
that returns a site instance. Defaults to
`'django.contrib.admin.sites.AdminSite'`. See
[Overriding the default admin site](#overriding-default-admin-site) for usage.

### autodiscover()

This function attempts to import an `admin` module in each installed
application. Such modules are expected to register models with the admin.

Typically you won’t need to call this function directly as
[`AdminConfig`](#django.contrib.admin.apps.AdminConfig) calls it when Django
starts.

If you are using a custom `AdminSite`, it is common to import all of the
`ModelAdmin` subclasses into your code and register them to the custom
`AdminSite`. In that case, in order to disable auto-discovery, you should
put `'django.contrib.admin.apps.SimpleAdminConfig'` instead of
`'django.contrib.admin'` in your [`INSTALLED_APPS`](../../settings.md#std-setting-INSTALLED_APPS) setting.

### `ModelAdmin` options

The `ModelAdmin` is very flexible. It has several options for dealing with
customizing the interface. All options are defined on the `ModelAdmin`
subclass:

```default
from django.contrib import admin


class AuthorAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    date_hierarchy = "pub_date"
```

#### ModelAdmin.actions

A list of actions to make available on the change list page. See
[Admin actions](actions.md) for details.

#### ModelAdmin.actions_on_top

#### ModelAdmin.actions_on_bottom

Controls where on the page the actions bar appears. By default, the admin
changelist displays actions at the top of the page (`actions_on_top =
True; actions_on_bottom = False`).

#### ModelAdmin.actions_selection_counter

Controls whether a selection counter is displayed next to the action
dropdown. By default, the admin changelist will display it
(`actions_selection_counter = True`).

#### ModelAdmin.date_hierarchy

Set `date_hierarchy` to the name of a `DateField` or `DateTimeField`
in your model, and the change list page will include a date-based drilldown
navigation by that field.

Example:

```default
date_hierarchy = "pub_date"
```

You can also specify a field on a related model using the `__` lookup,
for example:

```default
date_hierarchy = "author__pub_date"
```

This will intelligently populate itself based on available data,
e.g. if all the dates are in one month, it’ll show the day-level
drill-down only.

#### NOTE
`date_hierarchy` uses [`QuerySet.datetimes()`](../../models/querysets.md#django.db.models.query.QuerySet.datetimes) internally. Please refer
to its documentation for some caveats when time zone support is
enabled ([`USE_TZ = True`](../../settings.md#std-setting-USE_TZ)).

#### ModelAdmin.empty_value_display

This attribute overrides the default display value for record’s fields that
are empty (`None`, empty string, etc.). The default value is `-` (a
dash). For example:

```default
from django.contrib import admin


class AuthorAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    empty_value_display = "-empty-"
```

You can also override `empty_value_display` for all admin pages with
[`AdminSite.empty_value_display`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.empty_value_display), or for specific fields like this:

```default
from django.contrib import admin


class AuthorAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ["name", "title", "view_birth_date"]

    @admin.display(empty_value="???")
    def view_birth_date(self, obj):
        return obj.birth_date
```

#### ModelAdmin.exclude

This attribute, if given, should be a list of field names to exclude from
the form.

For example, let’s consider the following model:

```default
from django.db import models


class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=3)
    birth_date = models.DateField(blank=True, null=True)
```

If you want a form for the `Author` model that includes only the `name`
and `title` fields, you would specify `fields` or `exclude` like
this:

```default
from django.contrib import admin


class AuthorAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    fields = ["name", "title"]


class AuthorAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    exclude = ["birth_date"]
```

Since the Author model only has three fields, `name`, `title`, and
`birth_date`, the forms resulting from the above declarations will
contain exactly the same fields.

#### ModelAdmin.fields

Use the `fields` option to make simple layout changes in the forms on
the “add” and “change” pages such as showing only a subset of available
fields, modifying their order, or grouping them into rows. For example, you
could define a simpler version of the admin form for the
[`django.contrib.flatpages.models.FlatPage`](../flatpages.md#django.contrib.flatpages.models.FlatPage) model as follows:

```default
class FlatPageAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    fields = ["url", "title", "content"]
```

In the above example, only the fields `url`, `title` and `content`
will be displayed, sequentially, in the form. `fields` can contain
values defined in [`ModelAdmin.readonly_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.readonly_fields) to be displayed as
read-only.

For more complex layout needs, see the [`fieldsets`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fieldsets)
option.

The `fields` option accepts the same types of values as
[`list_display`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display), except that callables and `__` lookups
for related fields aren’t accepted. Names of model and model admin methods
will only be used if they’re listed in [`readonly_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.readonly_fields).

To display multiple fields on the same line, wrap those fields in their own
tuple. In this example, the `url` and `title` fields will display on
the same line and the `content` field will be displayed below them on its
own line:

```default
class FlatPageAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    fields = [("url", "title"), "content"]
```

If neither `fields` nor [`fieldsets`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fieldsets) options are
present, Django will default to displaying each field that isn’t an
`AutoField` and has `editable=True`, in a single fieldset, in the same
order as the fields are defined in the model, followed by any fields
defined in [`readonly_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.readonly_fields).

#### ModelAdmin.fieldsets

Set `fieldsets` to control the layout of admin “add” and “change” pages.

`fieldsets` is a list of 2-tuples, in which each 2-tuple represents a
`<fieldset>` on the admin form page. (A `<fieldset>` is a “section” of
the form.)

The 2-tuples are in the format `(name, field_options)`, where `name`
is a string representing the title of the fieldset and `field_options` is
a dictionary of information about the fieldset, including a list of fields
to be displayed in it.

A full example, taken from the
[`django.contrib.flatpages.models.FlatPage`](../flatpages.md#django.contrib.flatpages.models.FlatPage) model:

```default
from django.contrib import admin


class FlatPageAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    fieldsets = [
        (
            None,
            {
                "fields": ["url", "title", "content", "sites"],
            },
        ),
        (
            "Advanced options",
            {
                "classes": ["collapse"],
                "fields": ["registration_required", "template_name"],
            },
        ),
    ]
```

This results in an admin page that looks like:

![image](ref/contrib/admin/_images/fieldsets.png)

If neither `fieldsets` nor [`fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fields) options are
present, Django will default to displaying each field that isn’t an
`AutoField` and has `editable=True`, in a single fieldset, in the same
order as the fields are defined in the model.

The `field_options` dictionary can have the following keys:

* `fields`
  : A list or tuple of field names to display in this fieldset. This key is
    required.
    <br/>
    Example:
    ```default
    {
        "fields": ["first_name", "last_name", "address", "city", "state"],
    }
    ```
    <br/>
    As with the [`fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fields) option, to display multiple
    fields on the same line, wrap those fields in their own tuple. In this
    example, the `first_name` and `last_name` fields will display on
    the same line:
    ```default
    {
        "fields": [("first_name", "last_name"), "address", "city", "state"],
    }
    ```
    <br/>
    `fields` can contain values defined in
    [`readonly_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.readonly_fields) to be displayed as read-only.
    <br/>
    If you add the name of a callable to `fields`, the same rule applies
    as with the [`fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fields) option: the callable must be
    listed in [`readonly_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.readonly_fields).
* `classes`
  : A list or tuple containing extra CSS classes to apply to the fieldset.
    This can include any custom CSS class defined in the project, as well
    as any of the CSS classes provided by Django. Within the default admin
    site CSS stylesheet, two particularly useful classes are defined:
    `collapse` and `wide`.
    <br/>
    Example:
    ```default
    {
        "classes": ["wide", "collapse"],
    }
    ```
    <br/>
    Fieldsets with the `wide` style will be given extra horizontal
    space in the admin interface.
    Fieldsets with a name and the `collapse` style will be initially
    collapsed, using an expandable widget with a toggle for switching
    their visibility.
* `description`
  : A string of optional extra text to be displayed at the top of each
    fieldset, under the heading of the fieldset.
    <br/>
    Note that this value is *not* HTML-escaped when it’s displayed in
    the admin interface. This lets you include HTML if you so desire.
    Alternatively you can use plain text and
    [`django.utils.html.escape()`](../../utils.md#django.utils.html.escape) to escape any HTML special
    characters.

#### ModelAdmin.filter_horizontal

By default, a [`ManyToManyField`](../../models/fields.md#django.db.models.ManyToManyField) is displayed in
the admin site with a `<select multiple>`. However, multiple-select boxes
can be difficult to use when selecting many items. Adding a
[`ManyToManyField`](../../models/fields.md#django.db.models.ManyToManyField) to this list will instead use
a nifty unobtrusive JavaScript “filter” interface that allows searching
within the options. The unselected and selected options appear in two boxes
side by side. See [`filter_vertical`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.filter_vertical) to use a vertical
interface.

#### ModelAdmin.filter_vertical

Same as [`filter_horizontal`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.filter_horizontal), but uses a vertical display
of the filter interface with the box of unselected options appearing above
the box of selected options.

#### ModelAdmin.form

By default a `ModelForm` is dynamically created for your model. It is
used to create the form presented on both the add/change pages. You can
easily provide your own `ModelForm` to override any default form behavior
on the add/change pages. Alternatively, you can customize the default
form rather than specifying an entirely new one by using the
[`ModelAdmin.get_form()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_form) method.

For an example see the section [Adding custom validation to the admin](#admin-custom-validation).

#### ModelAdmin.formfield_overrides

This provides a quick-and-dirty way to override some of the
[`Field`](../../forms/fields.md#django.forms.Field) options for use in the admin.
`formfield_overrides` is a dictionary mapping a field class to a dict of
arguments to pass to the field at construction time.

Since that’s a bit abstract, let’s look at a concrete example. The most
common use of `formfield_overrides` is to add a custom widget for a
certain type of field. So, imagine we’ve written a `RichTextEditorWidget`
that we’d like to use for large text fields instead of the default
`<textarea>`. Here’s how we’d do that:

```default
from django.contrib import admin
from django.db import models

# Import our custom widget and our model from where they're defined
from myapp.models import MyModel
from myapp.widgets import RichTextEditorWidget


class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    formfield_overrides = {
        models.TextField: {"widget": RichTextEditorWidget},
    }
```

Note that the key in the dictionary is the actual field class, *not* a
string. The value is another dictionary; these arguments will be passed to
the form field’s `__init__()` method. See [The Forms API](../../forms/api.md) for
details.

#### WARNING
If you want to use a custom widget with a relation field (i.e.
[`ForeignKey`](../../models/fields.md#django.db.models.ForeignKey) or
[`ManyToManyField`](../../models/fields.md#django.db.models.ManyToManyField)), make sure you haven’t
included that field’s name in `raw_id_fields`, `radio_fields`, or
`autocomplete_fields`.

`formfield_overrides` won’t let you change the widget on relation
fields that have `raw_id_fields`, `radio_fields`, or
`autocomplete_fields` set. That’s because `raw_id_fields`,
`radio_fields`, and `autocomplete_fields` imply custom widgets of
their own.

#### ModelAdmin.inlines

See [`InlineModelAdmin`](#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin) objects below as well as
[`ModelAdmin.get_formsets_with_inlines()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_formsets_with_inlines).

#### ModelAdmin.list_display

Set `list_display` to control which fields are displayed on the change
list page of the admin.

Example:

```default
list_display = ["first_name", "last_name"]
```

If you don’t set `list_display`, the admin site will display a single
column that displays the `__str__()` representation of each object.

There are five types of values that can be used in `list_display`. All
but the simplest may use the  [`display()`](#django.contrib.admin.display)
decorator, which is used to customize how the field is presented:

* The name of a model field. For example:
  ```default
  class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      list_display = ["first_name", "last_name"]
  ```
* The name of a related field, using the `__` notation. For example:
  ```default
  class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      list_display = ["city__name"]
  ```
* A callable that accepts one argument, the model instance. For example:
  ```default
  @admin.display(description="Name")
  def upper_case_name(obj):
      return f"{obj.first_name} {obj.last_name}".upper()


  class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      list_display = [upper_case_name]
  ```
* A string representing a `ModelAdmin` method that accepts one argument,
  the model instance. For example:
  ```default
  class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      list_display = ["upper_case_name"]

      @admin.display(description="Name")
      def upper_case_name(self, obj):
          return f"{obj.first_name} {obj.last_name}".upper()
  ```
* A string representing a model attribute or method (without any required
  arguments). For example:
  ```default
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.db import models


  class Person(models.Model):
      name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
      birthday = models.DateField()

      @admin.display(description="Birth decade")
      def decade_born_in(self):
          decade = self.birthday.year // 10 * 10
          return f"{decade}’s"


  class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      list_display = ["name", "decade_born_in"]
  ```

A few special cases to note about `list_display`:

* If the field is a `ForeignKey`, Django will display the
  `__str__()` of the related object.
* `ManyToManyField` fields aren’t supported, because that would
  entail executing a separate SQL statement for each row in the table.
  If you want to do this nonetheless, give your model a custom method,
  and add that method’s name to `list_display`. (See below for more
  on custom methods in `list_display`.)
* If the field is a `BooleanField`, Django will display a pretty “yes”,
  “no”, or “unknown” icon instead of `True`, `False`, or `None`.
* If the string given is a method of the model, `ModelAdmin` or a
  callable, Django will HTML-escape the output by default. To escape
  user input and allow your own unescaped tags, use
  [`format_html()`](../../utils.md#django.utils.html.format_html).

  Here’s a full example model:
  ```default
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.db import models
  from django.utils.html import format_html


  class Person(models.Model):
      first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
      last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
      color_code = models.CharField(max_length=6)

      @admin.display
      def colored_name(self):
          return format_html(
              '<span style="color: #{};">{} {}</span>',
              self.color_code,
              self.first_name,
              self.last_name,
          )


  class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      list_display = ["first_name", "last_name", "colored_name"]
  ```
* As some examples have already demonstrated, when using a callable, a
  model method, or a `ModelAdmin` method, you can customize the column’s
  title by wrapping the callable with the
  [`display()`](#django.contrib.admin.display) decorator and passing the
  `description` argument.
* If the value of a field is `None`, an empty string, or an iterable
  without elements, Django will display `-` (a dash). You can override
  this with [`AdminSite.empty_value_display`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.empty_value_display):
  ```default
  from django.contrib import admin

  admin.site.empty_value_display = "(None)"
  ```

  You can also use [`ModelAdmin.empty_value_display`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.empty_value_display):
  ```default
  class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      empty_value_display = "unknown"
  ```

  Or on a field level:
  ```default
  class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      list_display = ["name", "birth_date_view"]

      @admin.display(empty_value="unknown")
      def birth_date_view(self, obj):
          return obj.birth_date
  ```
* If the string given is a method of the model, `ModelAdmin` or a
  callable that returns `True`, `False`, or `None`, Django will
  display a pretty “yes”, “no”, or “unknown” icon if you wrap the method
  with the [`display()`](#django.contrib.admin.display) decorator passing the
  `boolean` argument with the value set to `True`:
  ```default
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.db import models


  class Person(models.Model):
      first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
      birthday = models.DateField()

      @admin.display(boolean=True)
      def born_in_fifties(self):
          return 1950 <= self.birthday.year < 1960


  class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      list_display = ["name", "born_in_fifties"]
  ```
* The `__str__()` method is just as valid in `list_display` as any
  other model method, so it’s perfectly OK to do this:
  ```default
  list_display = ["__str__", "some_other_field"]
  ```
* Usually, elements of `list_display` that aren’t actual database
  fields can’t be used in sorting (because Django does all the sorting
  at the database level).

  However, if an element of `list_display` represents a certain database
  field, you can indicate this fact by using the
  [`display()`](#django.contrib.admin.display) decorator on the method, passing
  the `ordering` argument:
  ```default
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.db import models
  from django.utils.html import format_html


  class Person(models.Model):
      first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
      color_code = models.CharField(max_length=6)

      @admin.display(ordering="first_name")
      def colored_first_name(self):
          return format_html(
              '<span style="color: #{};">{}</span>',
              self.color_code,
              self.first_name,
          )


  class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      list_display = ["first_name", "colored_first_name"]
  ```

  The above will tell Django to order by the `first_name` field when
  trying to sort by `colored_first_name` in the admin.

  To indicate descending order with the `ordering` argument you can use a
  hyphen prefix on the field name. Using the above example, this would look
  like:
  ```default
  @admin.display(ordering="-first_name")
  def colored_first_name(self): ...
  ```

  The `ordering` argument supports query lookups to sort by values on
  related models. This example includes an “author first name” column in
  the list display and allows sorting it by first name:
  ```default
  class Blog(models.Model):
      title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
      author = models.ForeignKey(Person, on_delete=models.CASCADE)


  class BlogAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      list_display = ["title", "author", "author_first_name"]

      @admin.display(ordering="author__first_name")
      def author_first_name(self, obj):
          return obj.author.first_name
  ```

  [Query expressions](../../models/expressions.md) may be used with the
  `ordering` argument:
  ```default
  from django.db.models import Value
  from django.db.models.functions import Concat


  class Person(models.Model):
      first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
      last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)

      @admin.display(ordering=Concat("first_name", Value(" "), "last_name"))
      def full_name(self):
          return self.first_name + " " + self.last_name
  ```
* Elements of `list_display` can also be properties
  ```default
  class Person(models.Model):
      first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
      last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)

      @property
      @admin.display(
          ordering="last_name",
          description="Full name of the person",
          boolean=False,
      )
      def full_name(self):
          return self.first_name + " " + self.last_name


  class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      list_display = ["full_name"]
  ```

  Note that `@property` must be above `@display`. If you’re using the
  old way – setting the display-related attributes directly rather than
  using the [`display()`](#django.contrib.admin.display) decorator –  be aware
  that the `property()` function and **not** the `@property` decorator
  must be used:
  ```default
  def my_property(self):
      return self.first_name + " " + self.last_name


  my_property.short_description = "Full name of the person"
  my_property.admin_order_field = "last_name"
  my_property.boolean = False

  full_name = property(my_property)
  ```
* The field names in `list_display` will also appear as CSS classes in
  the HTML output, in the form of `column-<field_name>` on each `<th>`
  element. This can be used to set column widths in a CSS file for example.
* Django will try to interpret every element of `list_display` in this
  order:
  * A field of the model or from a related field.
  * A callable.
  * A string representing a `ModelAdmin` attribute.
  * A string representing a model attribute.

  For example if you have `first_name` as a model field and
  as a `ModelAdmin` attribute, the model field will be used.

#### ModelAdmin.list_display_links

Use `list_display_links` to control if and which fields in
[`list_display`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display) should be linked to the “change” page for an object.

By default, the change list page will link the first column – the first
field specified in `list_display` – to the change page for each item.
But `list_display_links` lets you change this:

* Set it to `None` to get no links at all.
* Set it to a list or tuple of fields (in the same format as
  `list_display`) whose columns you want converted to links.

  You can specify one or many fields. As long as the fields appear in
  `list_display`, Django doesn’t care how many (or how few) fields are
  linked. The only requirement is that if you want to use
  `list_display_links` in this fashion, you must define `list_display`.

In this example, the `first_name` and `last_name` fields will be
linked on the change list page:

```default
class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ["first_name", "last_name", "birthday"]
    list_display_links = ["first_name", "last_name"]
```

In this example, the change list page grid will have no links:

```default
class AuditEntryAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ["timestamp", "message"]
    list_display_links = None
```

<a id="admin-list-editable"></a>

#### ModelAdmin.list_editable

Set `list_editable` to a list of field names on the model which will
allow editing on the change list page. That is, fields listed in
`list_editable` will be displayed as form widgets on the change list
page, allowing users to edit and save multiple rows at once.

#### NOTE
`list_editable` interacts with a couple of other options in
particular ways; you should note the following rules:

* Any field in `list_editable` must also be in `list_display`.
  You can’t edit a field that’s not displayed!
* The same field can’t be listed in both `list_editable` and
  `list_display_links` – a field can’t be both a form and
  a link.

You’ll get a validation error if either of these rules are broken.

#### ModelAdmin.list_filter

Set `list_filter` to activate filters in the right sidebar of the change
list page of the admin.

At it’s simplest `list_filter` takes a list or tuple of field names to
activate filtering upon, but several more advanced options as available.
See [ModelAdmin List Filters](filters.md#modeladmin-list-filters) for the details.

#### ModelAdmin.list_max_show_all

Set `list_max_show_all` to control how many items can appear on a “Show
all” admin change list page. The admin will display a “Show all” link on
the change list only if the total result count is less than or equal to
this setting. By default, this is set to `200`.

#### ModelAdmin.list_per_page

Set `list_per_page` to control how many items appear on each paginated
admin change list page. By default, this is set to `100`.

#### ModelAdmin.list_select_related

Set `list_select_related` to tell Django to use
[`select_related()`](../../models/querysets.md#django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_related) in retrieving
the list of objects on the admin change list page. This can save you a
bunch of database queries.

The value should be either a boolean, a list or a tuple. Default is
`False`.

When value is `True`, `select_related()` will always be called. When
value is set to `False`, Django will look at `list_display` and call
`select_related()` if any `ForeignKey` is present.

If you need more fine-grained control, use a tuple (or list) as value for
`list_select_related`. Empty tuple will prevent Django from calling
`select_related` at all. Any other tuple will be passed directly to
`select_related` as parameters. For example:

```default
class ArticleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_select_related = ["author", "category"]
```

will call `select_related('author', 'category')`.

If you need to specify a dynamic value based on the request, you can
implement a [`get_list_select_related()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_list_select_related) method.

#### NOTE
`ModelAdmin` ignores this attribute when
[`select_related()`](../../models/querysets.md#django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_related) was already
called on the changelist’s `QuerySet`.

#### ModelAdmin.ordering

Set `ordering` to specify how lists of objects should be ordered in the
Django admin views. This should be a list or tuple in the same format as a
model’s [`ordering`](../../models/options.md#django.db.models.Options.ordering) parameter.

If this isn’t provided, the Django admin will use the model’s default
ordering.

If you need to specify a dynamic order (for example depending on user or
language) you can implement a [`get_ordering()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_ordering) method.

#### ModelAdmin.paginator

The paginator class to be used for pagination. By default,
[`django.core.paginator.Paginator`](../../paginator.md#django.core.paginator.Paginator) is used. If the custom paginator
class doesn’t have the same constructor interface as
[`django.core.paginator.Paginator`](../../paginator.md#django.core.paginator.Paginator), you will also need to
provide an implementation for [`ModelAdmin.get_paginator()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_paginator).

#### ModelAdmin.prepopulated_fields

Set `prepopulated_fields` to a dictionary mapping field names to the
fields it should prepopulate from:

```default
class ArticleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    prepopulated_fields = {"slug": ["title"]}
```

When set, the given fields will use a bit of JavaScript to populate from
the fields assigned. The main use for this functionality is to
automatically generate the value for `SlugField` fields from one or more
other fields. The generated value is produced by concatenating the values
of the source fields, and then by transforming that result into a valid
slug (e.g. substituting dashes for spaces and lowercasing ASCII letters).

Prepopulated fields aren’t modified by JavaScript after a value has been
saved. It’s usually undesired that slugs change (which would cause an
object’s URL to change if the slug is used in it).

`prepopulated_fields` doesn’t accept `DateTimeField`, `ForeignKey`,
`OneToOneField`, and `ManyToManyField` fields.

#### ModelAdmin.preserve_filters

By default, applied filters are preserved on the list view after creating,
editing, or deleting an object. You can have filters cleared by setting
this attribute to `False`.

#### ModelAdmin.show_facets

Controls whether facet counts are displayed for filters in the admin
changelist. Defaults to [`ShowFacets.ALLOW`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.ShowFacets.ALLOW).

When displayed, facet counts update in line with currently applied filters.

#### *class* ShowFacets

Enum of allowed values for [`ModelAdmin.show_facets`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.show_facets).

#### ALWAYS

Always show facet counts.

#### ALLOW

Show facet counts when the `_facets` query string parameter is
provided.

#### NEVER

Never show facet counts.

Set `show_facets` to the desired [`ShowFacets`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.ShowFacets) value. For example,
to always show facet counts without needing to provide the query
parameter:

```default
from django.contrib import admin


class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    ...
    # Have facets always shown for this model admin.
    show_facets = admin.ShowFacets.ALWAYS
```

#### ModelAdmin.radio_fields

By default, Django’s admin uses a select-box interface (<select>) for
fields that are `ForeignKey` or have `choices` set. If a field is
present in `radio_fields`, Django will use a radio-button interface
instead. Assuming `group` is a `ForeignKey` on the `Person` model:

```default
class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    radio_fields = {"group": admin.VERTICAL}
```

You have the choice of using `HORIZONTAL` or `VERTICAL` from the
`django.contrib.admin` module.

Don’t include a field in `radio_fields` unless it’s a `ForeignKey` or
has `choices` set.

#### ModelAdmin.autocomplete_fields

`autocomplete_fields` is a list of `ForeignKey` and/or
`ManyToManyField` fields you would like to change to [Select2](https://select2.org/) autocomplete inputs.

By default, the admin uses a select-box interface (`<select>`) for
those fields. Sometimes you don’t want to incur the overhead of selecting
all the related instances to display in the dropdown.

The Select2 input looks similar to the default input but comes with a
search feature that loads the options asynchronously. This is faster and
more user-friendly if the related model has many instances.

You must define [`search_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.search_fields) on the related object’s
`ModelAdmin` because the autocomplete search uses it.

To avoid unauthorized data disclosure, users must have the `view` or
`change` permission to the related object in order to use autocomplete.

Ordering and pagination of the results are controlled by the related
`ModelAdmin`’s [`get_ordering()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_ordering) and
[`get_paginator()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_paginator) methods.

In the following example, `ChoiceAdmin` has an autocomplete field for the
`ForeignKey` to the `Question`. The results are filtered by the
`question_text` field and ordered by the `date_created` field:

```default
class QuestionAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    ordering = ["date_created"]
    search_fields = ["question_text"]


class ChoiceAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    autocomplete_fields = ["question"]
```

#### ModelAdmin.raw_id_fields

By default, Django’s admin uses a select-box interface (<select>) for
fields that are `ForeignKey`. Sometimes you don’t want to incur the
overhead of having to select all the related instances to display in the
drop-down.

`raw_id_fields` is a list of fields you would like to change
into an `Input` widget for either a `ForeignKey` or
`ManyToManyField`:

```default
class ArticleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    raw_id_fields = ["newspaper"]
```

The `raw_id_fields` `Input` widget should contain a primary key if the
field is a `ForeignKey` or a comma separated list of values if the field
is a `ManyToManyField`. The `raw_id_fields` widget shows a magnifying
glass button next to the field which allows users to search for and select
a value:

![image](ref/contrib/admin/_images/raw_id_fields.png)

#### ModelAdmin.readonly_fields

By default the admin shows all fields as editable. Any fields in this
option (which should be a `list` or `tuple`) will display its data
as-is and non-editable; they are also excluded from the
[`ModelForm`](../../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#django.forms.ModelForm) used for creating and editing. Note that
when specifying [`ModelAdmin.fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fields) or [`ModelAdmin.fieldsets`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fieldsets)
the read-only fields must be present to be shown (they are ignored
otherwise).

If `readonly_fields` is used without defining explicit ordering through
[`ModelAdmin.fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fields) or [`ModelAdmin.fieldsets`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fieldsets) they will be
added last after all editable fields.

A read-only field can not only display data from a model’s field, it can
also display the output of a model’s method or a method of the
`ModelAdmin` class itself. This is very similar to the way
[`ModelAdmin.list_display`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display) behaves. This provides a way to use the
admin interface to provide feedback on the status of the objects being
edited, for example:

```default
from django.contrib import admin
from django.utils.html import format_html_join
from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe


class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    readonly_fields = ["address_report"]

    # description functions like a model field's verbose_name
    @admin.display(description="Address")
    def address_report(self, instance):
        # assuming get_full_address() returns a list of strings
        # for each line of the address and you want to separate each
        # line by a linebreak
        return format_html_join(
            mark_safe("<br>"),
            "{}",
            ((line,) for line in instance.get_full_address()),
        ) or mark_safe("<span class='errors'>I can't determine this address.</span>")
```

#### ModelAdmin.save_as

Set `save_as` to enable a “save as new” feature on admin change forms.

Normally, objects have three save options: “Save”, “Save and continue
editing”, and “Save and add another”. If `save_as` is `True`, “Save
and add another” will be replaced by a “Save as new” button that creates a
new object (with a new ID) rather than updating the existing object.

By default, `save_as` is set to `False`.

#### ModelAdmin.save_as_continue

When [`save_as=True`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.save_as), the default redirect after saving the
new object is to the change view for that object. If you set
`save_as_continue=False`, the redirect will be to the changelist view.

By default, `save_as_continue` is set to `True`.

#### ModelAdmin.save_on_top

Set `save_on_top` to add save buttons across the top of your admin change
forms.

Normally, the save buttons appear only at the bottom of the forms. If you
set `save_on_top`, the buttons will appear both on the top and the
bottom.

By default, `save_on_top` is set to `False`.

#### ModelAdmin.search_fields

Set `search_fields` to enable a search box on the admin change list page.
This should be set to a list of field names that will be searched whenever
somebody submits a search query in that text box.

These fields should be some kind of text field, such as `CharField` or
`TextField`. You can also perform a related lookup on a `ForeignKey` or
`ManyToManyField` with the lookup API “follow” notation:

```default
search_fields = ["foreign_key__related_fieldname"]
```

For example, if you have a blog entry with an author, the following
definition would enable searching blog entries by the email address of the
author:

```default
search_fields = ["user__email"]
```

When somebody does a search in the admin search box, Django splits the
search query into words and returns all objects that contain each of the
words, case-insensitive (using the [`icontains`](../../models/querysets.md#std-fieldlookup-icontains) lookup), where each
word must be in at least one of `search_fields`. For example, if
`search_fields` is set to `['first_name', 'last_name']` and a user
searches for `john lennon`, Django will do the equivalent of this SQL
`WHERE` clause:

```sql
WHERE (first_name ILIKE '%john%' OR last_name ILIKE '%john%')
AND (first_name ILIKE '%lennon%' OR last_name ILIKE '%lennon%')
```

The search query can contain quoted phrases with spaces. For example, if a
user searches for `"john winston"` or `'john winston'`, Django will do
the equivalent of this SQL `WHERE` clause:

```sql
WHERE (first_name ILIKE '%john winston%' OR last_name ILIKE '%john winston%')
```

If you don’t want to use `icontains` as the lookup, you can use any
lookup by appending it the field. For example, you could use
[`exact`](../../models/querysets.md#std-fieldlookup-exact) by setting `search_fields` to `['first_name__exact']`.

Some (older) shortcuts for specifying a field lookup are also available.
You can prefix a field in `search_fields` with the following characters
and it’s equivalent to adding `__<lookup>` to the field:

| Prefix   | Lookup                                                                 |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ^        | [`istartswith`](../../models/querysets.md#std-fieldlookup-istartswith) |
| =        | [`iexact`](../../models/querysets.md#std-fieldlookup-iexact)           |
| @        | [`search`](../postgres/search.md#std-fieldlookup-search)               |
| None     | [`icontains`](../../models/querysets.md#std-fieldlookup-icontains)     |

If you need to customize search you can use
[`ModelAdmin.get_search_results()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_search_results) to provide additional or alternate
search behavior.

#### ModelAdmin.search_help_text

Set `search_help_text` to specify a descriptive text for the search box
which will be displayed below it.

#### ModelAdmin.show_full_result_count

Set `show_full_result_count` to control whether the full count of objects
should be displayed on a filtered admin page (e.g. `99 results (103
total)`). If this option is set to `False`, a text like `99 results
(Show all)` is displayed instead.

The default of `show_full_result_count=True` generates a query to perform
a full count on the table which can be expensive if the table contains a
large number of rows.

#### ModelAdmin.sortable_by

By default, the change list page allows sorting by all model fields (and
callables that use the `ordering` argument to the
[`display()`](#django.contrib.admin.display) decorator or have the
`admin_order_field` attribute) specified in [`list_display`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display).

If you want to disable sorting for some columns, set `sortable_by` to
a collection (e.g. `list`, `tuple`, or `set`) of the subset of
[`list_display`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display) that you want to be sortable. An empty collection
disables sorting for all columns.

If you need to specify this list dynamically, implement a
[`get_sortable_by()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_sortable_by) method instead.

#### ModelAdmin.view_on_site

Set `view_on_site` to control whether or not to display the “View on
site” link. This link should bring you to a URL where you can display the
saved object.

This value can be either a boolean flag or a callable. If `True` (the
default), the object’s [`get_absolute_url()`](../../models/instances.md#django.db.models.Model.get_absolute_url)
method will be used to generate the url.

If your model has a [`get_absolute_url()`](../../models/instances.md#django.db.models.Model.get_absolute_url) method
but you don’t want the “View on site” button to appear, you only need to
set `view_on_site` to `False`:

```default
from django.contrib import admin


class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    view_on_site = False
```

In case it is a callable, it accepts the model instance as a parameter.
For example:

```default
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import reverse


class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def view_on_site(self, obj):
        url = reverse("person-detail", kwargs={"slug": obj.slug})
        return "https://example.com" + url
```

#### Custom template options

The [Overriding admin templates](#admin-overriding-templates) section describes how to override or
extend the default admin templates. Use the following options to override the
default templates used by the [`ModelAdmin`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin) views:

#### ModelAdmin.add_form_template

Path to a custom template, used by [`add_view()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.add_view).

#### ModelAdmin.change_form_template

Path to a custom template, used by [`change_view()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.change_view).

#### ModelAdmin.change_list_template

Path to a custom template, used by [`changelist_view()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.changelist_view).

#### ModelAdmin.delete_confirmation_template

Path to a custom template, used by [`delete_view()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.delete_view) for displaying a
confirmation page when deleting one or more objects.

#### ModelAdmin.delete_selected_confirmation_template

Path to a custom template, used by the `delete_selected` action method
for displaying a confirmation page when deleting one or more objects. See
the [actions documentation](actions.md).

#### ModelAdmin.object_history_template

Path to a custom template, used by [`history_view()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.history_view).

#### ModelAdmin.popup_response_template

Path to a custom template, used by [`response_add()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.response_add),
[`response_change()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.response_change), and [`response_delete()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.response_delete).

<a id="model-admin-methods"></a>

### `ModelAdmin` methods

#### WARNING
When overriding [`ModelAdmin.save_model()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.save_model) and
[`ModelAdmin.delete_model()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.delete_model), your code must save/delete the
object. They aren’t meant for veto purposes, rather they allow you to
perform extra operations.

#### ModelAdmin.save_model(request, obj, form, change)

The `save_model` method is given the `HttpRequest`, a model instance,
a `ModelForm` instance, and a boolean value based on whether it is adding
or changing the object. Overriding this method allows doing pre- or
post-save operations. Call `super().save_model()` to save the object
using [`Model.save()`](../../models/instances.md#django.db.models.Model.save).

For example to attach `request.user` to the object prior to saving:

```default
from django.contrib import admin


class ArticleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def save_model(self, request, obj, form, change):
        obj.user = request.user
        super().save_model(request, obj, form, change)
```

#### ModelAdmin.delete_model(request, obj)

The `delete_model` method is given the `HttpRequest` and a model
instance. Overriding this method allows doing pre- or post-delete
operations. Call `super().delete_model()` to delete the object using
[`Model.delete()`](../../models/instances.md#django.db.models.Model.delete).

#### ModelAdmin.delete_queryset(request, queryset)

The `delete_queryset()` method is given the `HttpRequest` and a
`QuerySet` of objects to be deleted. Override this method to customize
the deletion process for the “delete selected objects” [action](actions.md).

#### ModelAdmin.save_formset(request, form, formset, change)

The `save_formset` method is given the `HttpRequest`, the parent
`ModelForm` instance and a boolean value based on whether it is adding or
changing the parent object.

For example, to attach `request.user` to each changed formset
model instance:

```default
class ArticleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def save_formset(self, request, form, formset, change):
        instances = formset.save(commit=False)
        for obj in formset.deleted_objects:
            obj.delete()
        for instance in instances:
            instance.user = request.user
            instance.save()
        formset.save_m2m()
```

See also [Saving objects in the formset](../../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#saving-objects-in-the-formset).

#### WARNING
All hooks that return a `ModelAdmin` property return the property itself
rather than a copy of its value. Dynamically modifying the value can lead
to surprising results.

Let’s take [`ModelAdmin.get_readonly_fields()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_readonly_fields) as an example:

```default
class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    readonly_fields = ["name"]

    def get_readonly_fields(self, request, obj=None):
        readonly = super().get_readonly_fields(request, obj)
        if not request.user.is_superuser:
            readonly.append("age")  # Edits the class attribute.
        return readonly
```

This results in `readonly_fields` becoming `["name", "age", "age",
...]`, even for a superuser, as `"age"` is added each time non-superuser
visits the page.

#### ModelAdmin.get_ordering(request)

The `get_ordering` method takes a `request` as parameter and
is expected to return a `list` or `tuple` for ordering similar
to the [`ordering`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.ordering) attribute. For example:

```default
class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def get_ordering(self, request):
        if request.user.is_superuser:
            return ["name", "rank"]
        else:
            return ["name"]
```

#### ModelAdmin.get_search_results(request, queryset, search_term)

The `get_search_results` method modifies the list of objects displayed
into those that match the provided search term. It accepts the request, a
queryset that applies the current filters, and the user-provided search
term. It returns a tuple containing a queryset modified to implement the
search, and a boolean indicating if the results may contain duplicates.

The default implementation searches the fields named in
[`ModelAdmin.search_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.search_fields).

This method may be overridden with your own custom search method. For
example, you might wish to search by an integer field, or use an external
tool such as [Solr](https://solr.apache.org) or [Haystack](https://haystacksearch.org). You must establish if the queryset
changes implemented by your search method may introduce duplicates into the
results, and return `True` in the second element of the return value.

For example, to search by `name` and `age`, you could use:

```default
class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ["name", "age"]
    search_fields = ["name"]

    def get_search_results(self, request, queryset, search_term):
        queryset, may_have_duplicates = super().get_search_results(
            request,
            queryset,
            search_term,
        )
        try:
            search_term_as_int = int(search_term)
        except ValueError:
            pass
        else:
            queryset |= self.model.objects.filter(age=search_term_as_int)
        return queryset, may_have_duplicates
```

This implementation is more efficient than `search_fields =
('name', '=age')` which results in a string comparison for the numeric
field, for example
`... OR UPPER("polls_choice"."votes"::text) = UPPER('4')` on PostgreSQL.

#### ModelAdmin.save_related(request, form, formsets, change)

The `save_related` method is given the `HttpRequest`, the parent
`ModelForm` instance, the list of inline formsets and a boolean value
based on whether the parent is being added or changed. Here you can do any
pre- or post-save operations for objects related to the parent. Note
that at this point the parent object and its form have already been saved.

#### ModelAdmin.get_autocomplete_fields(request)

The `get_autocomplete_fields()` method is given the `HttpRequest` and
is expected to return a `list` or `tuple` of field names that will be
displayed with an autocomplete widget as described above in the
[`ModelAdmin.autocomplete_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.autocomplete_fields) section.

#### ModelAdmin.get_readonly_fields(request, obj=None)

The `get_readonly_fields` method is given the `HttpRequest` and the
`obj` being edited (or `None` on an add form) and is expected to return
a `list` or `tuple` of field names that will be displayed as read-only,
as described above in the [`ModelAdmin.readonly_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.readonly_fields) section.

#### ModelAdmin.get_prepopulated_fields(request, obj=None)

The `get_prepopulated_fields` method is given the `HttpRequest` and the
`obj` being edited (or `None` on an add form) and is expected to return
a `dictionary`, as described above in the
[`ModelAdmin.prepopulated_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.prepopulated_fields) section.

#### ModelAdmin.get_list_display(request)

The `get_list_display` method is given the `HttpRequest` and is
expected to return a `list` or `tuple` of field names that will be
displayed on the changelist view as described above in the
[`ModelAdmin.list_display`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display) section.

#### ModelAdmin.get_list_display_links(request, list_display)

The `get_list_display_links` method is given the `HttpRequest` and the
`list` or `tuple` returned by [`ModelAdmin.get_list_display()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_list_display). It
is expected to return either `None` or a `list` or `tuple` of field
names on the changelist that will be linked to the change view, as
described in the [`ModelAdmin.list_display_links`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display_links) section.

#### ModelAdmin.get_exclude(request, obj=None)

The `get_exclude` method is given the `HttpRequest` and the `obj`
being edited (or `None` on an add form) and is expected to return a list
of fields, as described in [`ModelAdmin.exclude`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.exclude).

#### ModelAdmin.get_fields(request, obj=None)

The `get_fields` method is given the `HttpRequest` and the `obj`
being edited (or `None` on an add form) and is expected to return a list
of fields, as described above in the [`ModelAdmin.fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fields) section.

#### ModelAdmin.get_fieldsets(request, obj=None)

The `get_fieldsets` method is given the `HttpRequest` and the `obj`
being edited (or `None` on an add form) and is expected to return a list
of 2-tuples, in which each 2-tuple represents a `<fieldset>` on the
admin form page, as described above in the [`ModelAdmin.fieldsets`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fieldsets)
section.

#### ModelAdmin.get_list_filter(request)

The `get_list_filter` method is given the `HttpRequest` and is expected
to return the same kind of sequence type as for the
[`list_filter`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_filter) attribute.

#### ModelAdmin.get_list_select_related(request)

The `get_list_select_related` method is given the `HttpRequest` and
should return a boolean or list as [`ModelAdmin.list_select_related`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_select_related)
does.

#### ModelAdmin.get_search_fields(request)

The `get_search_fields` method is given the `HttpRequest` and is
expected to return the same kind of sequence type as for the
[`search_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.search_fields) attribute.

#### ModelAdmin.get_sortable_by(request)

The `get_sortable_by()` method is passed the `HttpRequest` and is
expected to return a collection (e.g. `list`, `tuple`, or `set`) of
field names that will be sortable in the change list page.

Its default implementation returns [`sortable_by`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.sortable_by) if it’s set,
otherwise it defers to [`get_list_display()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_list_display).

For example, to prevent one or more columns from being sortable:

```default
class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def get_sortable_by(self, request):
        return {*self.get_list_display(request)} - {"rank"}
```

#### ModelAdmin.get_inline_instances(request, obj=None)

The `get_inline_instances` method is given the `HttpRequest` and the
`obj` being edited (or `None` on an add form) and is expected to return
a `list` or `tuple` of [`InlineModelAdmin`](#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin)
objects, as described below in the
[`InlineModelAdmin`](#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin) section. For example, the
following would return inlines without the default filtering based on add,
change, delete, and view permissions:

```default
class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    inlines = [MyInline]

    def get_inline_instances(self, request, obj=None):
        return [inline(self.model, self.admin_site) for inline in self.inlines]
```

If you override this method, make sure that the returned inlines are
instances of the classes defined in [`inlines`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.inlines) or you might encounter
a “Bad Request” error when adding related objects.

#### ModelAdmin.get_inlines(request, obj)

The `get_inlines` method is given the `HttpRequest` and the
`obj` being edited (or `None` on an add form) and is expected to return
an iterable of inlines. You can override this method to dynamically add
inlines based on the request or model instance instead of specifying them
in [`ModelAdmin.inlines`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.inlines).

#### ModelAdmin.get_urls()

The `get_urls` method on a `ModelAdmin` returns the URLs to be used for
that ModelAdmin in the same way as a URLconf. Therefore you can extend
them as documented in [URL dispatcher](../../../topics/http/urls.md), using the
`AdminSite.admin_view()` wrapper on your views:

```default
from django.contrib import admin
from django.template.response import TemplateResponse
from django.urls import path


class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def get_urls(self):
        urls = super().get_urls()
        my_urls = [path("my_view/", self.admin_site.admin_view(self.my_view))]
        return my_urls + urls

    def my_view(self, request):
        # ...
        context = dict(
            # Include common variables for rendering the admin template.
            self.admin_site.each_context(request),
            # Anything else you want in the context...
            key=value,
        )
        return TemplateResponse(request, "sometemplate.html", context)
```

If you want to use the admin layout, extend from `admin/base_site.html`:

```html+django
{% extends "admin/base_site.html" %}
{% block content %}
...
{% endblock %}
```

#### NOTE
Notice how the `self.my_view` function is wrapped in
`self.admin_site.admin_view`. This is important, since it ensures two
things:

1. Permission checks are run, ensuring only active staff users can
   access the view.
2. The [`django.views.decorators.cache.never_cache()`](../../../topics/http/decorators.md#django.views.decorators.cache.never_cache) decorator is
   applied to prevent caching, ensuring the returned information is
   up-to-date.

#### NOTE
Notice that the custom patterns are included *before* the regular admin
URLs: the admin URL patterns are very permissive and will match nearly
anything, so you’ll usually want to prepend your custom URLs to the
built-in ones.

In this example, `my_view` will be accessed at
`/admin/myapp/mymodel/my_view/` (assuming the admin URLs are included
at `/admin/`.)

If the page is cacheable, but you still want the permission check to be
performed, you can pass a `cacheable=True` argument to
`AdminSite.admin_view()`:

```default
path("my_view/", self.admin_site.admin_view(self.my_view, cacheable=True))
```

`ModelAdmin` views have `model_admin` attributes. Other
`AdminSite` views have `admin_site` attributes.

#### ModelAdmin.get_form(request, obj=None, \*\*kwargs)

Returns a [`ModelForm`](../../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#django.forms.ModelForm) class for use in the admin add
and change views, see [`add_view()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.add_view) and [`change_view()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.change_view).

The base implementation uses [`modelform_factory()`](../../forms/models.md#django.forms.models.modelform_factory)
to subclass [`form`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.form), modified by attributes such as [`fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fields)
and [`exclude`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.exclude). So, for example, if you wanted to offer additional
fields to superusers, you could swap in a different base form like so:

```default
class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def get_form(self, request, obj=None, **kwargs):
        if request.user.is_superuser:
            kwargs["form"] = MySuperuserForm
        return super().get_form(request, obj, **kwargs)
```

You may also return a custom [`ModelForm`](../../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#django.forms.ModelForm) class
directly.

#### ModelAdmin.get_formsets_with_inlines(request, obj=None)

Yields (`FormSet`, [`InlineModelAdmin`](#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin)) pairs for use in admin add
and change views.

For example if you wanted to display a particular inline only in the change
view, you could override `get_formsets_with_inlines` as follows:

```default
class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    inlines = [MyInline, SomeOtherInline]

    def get_formsets_with_inlines(self, request, obj=None):
        for inline in self.get_inline_instances(request, obj):
            # hide MyInline in the add view
            if not isinstance(inline, MyInline) or obj is not None:
                yield inline.get_formset(request, obj), inline
```

#### ModelAdmin.formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, \*\*kwargs)

The `formfield_for_foreignkey` method on a `ModelAdmin` allows you to
override the default formfield for a foreign keys field. For example, to
return a subset of objects for this foreign key field based on the user:

```default
class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):
        if db_field.name == "car":
            kwargs["queryset"] = Car.objects.filter(owner=request.user)
        return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)
```

This uses the `HttpRequest` instance to filter the `Car` foreign key
field to only display the cars owned by the `User` instance.

For more complex filters, you can use `ModelForm.__init__()` method to
filter based on an `instance` of your model (see
[Fields which handle relationships](../../forms/fields.md#fields-which-handle-relationships)). For example:

```default
class CountryAdminForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields["capital"].queryset = self.instance.cities.all()


class CountryAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    form = CountryAdminForm
```

#### ModelAdmin.formfield_for_manytomany(db_field, request, \*\*kwargs)

Like the `formfield_for_foreignkey` method, the
`formfield_for_manytomany` method can be overridden to change the
default formfield for a many to many field. For example, if an owner can
own multiple cars and cars can belong to multiple owners – a many to
many relationship – you could filter the `Car` foreign key field to
only display the cars owned by the `User`:

```default
class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def formfield_for_manytomany(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):
        if db_field.name == "cars":
            kwargs["queryset"] = Car.objects.filter(owner=request.user)
        return super().formfield_for_manytomany(db_field, request, **kwargs)
```

#### ModelAdmin.formfield_for_choice_field(db_field, request, \*\*kwargs)

Like the `formfield_for_foreignkey` and `formfield_for_manytomany`
methods, the `formfield_for_choice_field` method can be overridden to
change the default formfield for a field that has declared choices. For
example, if the choices available to a superuser should be different than
those available to regular staff, you could proceed as follows:

```default
class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def formfield_for_choice_field(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):
        if db_field.name == "status":
            kwargs["choices"] = [
                ("accepted", "Accepted"),
                ("denied", "Denied"),
            ]
            if request.user.is_superuser:
                kwargs["choices"].append(("ready", "Ready for deployment"))
        return super().formfield_for_choice_field(db_field, request, **kwargs)
```

#### ModelAdmin.get_changelist(request, \*\*kwargs)

Returns the `Changelist` class to be used for listing. By default,
`django.contrib.admin.views.main.ChangeList` is used. By inheriting this
class you can change the behavior of the listing.

#### ModelAdmin.get_changelist_form(request, \*\*kwargs)

Returns a [`ModelForm`](../../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#django.forms.ModelForm) class for use in the `Formset`
on the changelist page. To use a custom form, for example:

```default
from django import forms


class MyForm(forms.ModelForm):
    pass


class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def get_changelist_form(self, request, **kwargs):
        return MyForm
```

#### ModelAdmin.get_changelist_formset(request, \*\*kwargs)

Returns a [ModelFormSet](../../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#model-formsets) class for use on the
changelist page if [`list_editable`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_editable) is used. To use a
custom formset, for example:

```default
from django.forms import BaseModelFormSet


class MyAdminFormSet(BaseModelFormSet):
    pass


class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def get_changelist_formset(self, request, **kwargs):
        kwargs["formset"] = MyAdminFormSet
        return super().get_changelist_formset(request, **kwargs)
```

#### ModelAdmin.lookup_allowed(lookup, value, request)

The objects in the changelist page can be filtered with lookups from the
URL’s query string. This is how [`list_filter`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_filter) works, for example. The
lookups are similar to what’s used in [`QuerySet.filter()`](../../models/querysets.md#django.db.models.query.QuerySet.filter) (e.g.
`user__email=user@example.com`). Since the lookups in the query string
can be manipulated by the user, they must be sanitized to prevent
unauthorized data exposure.

The `lookup_allowed()` method is given a lookup path from the query
string (e.g. `'user__email'`), the corresponding value (e.g.
`'user@example.com'`), and the request, and returns a boolean indicating
whether filtering the changelist’s `QuerySet` using the parameters is
permitted. If `lookup_allowed()` returns `False`,
`DisallowedModelAdminLookup` (subclass of
[`SuspiciousOperation`](../../exceptions.md#django.core.exceptions.SuspiciousOperation)) is raised.

By default, `lookup_allowed()` allows access to a model’s local fields,
field paths used in [`list_filter`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_filter) (but not paths from
[`get_list_filter()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_list_filter)), and lookups required for
[`limit_choices_to`](../../models/fields.md#django.db.models.ForeignKey.limit_choices_to) to function
correctly in [`raw_id_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.raw_id_fields).

Override this method to customize the lookups permitted for your
[`ModelAdmin`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin) subclass.

#### ModelAdmin.has_view_permission(request, obj=None)

Should return `True` if viewing `obj` is permitted, `False`
otherwise. If obj is `None`, should return `True` or `False` to
indicate whether viewing of objects of this type is permitted in general
(e.g., `False` will be interpreted as meaning that the current user is
not permitted to view any object of this type).

The default implementation returns `True` if the user has either the
“change” or “view” permission.

#### ModelAdmin.has_add_permission(request)

Should return `True` if adding an object is permitted, `False`
otherwise.

#### ModelAdmin.has_change_permission(request, obj=None)

Should return `True` if editing `obj` is permitted, `False`
otherwise. If `obj` is `None`, should return `True` or `False` to
indicate whether editing of objects of this type is permitted in general
(e.g., `False` will be interpreted as meaning that the current user is
not permitted to edit any object of this type).

#### ModelAdmin.has_delete_permission(request, obj=None)

Should return `True` if deleting `obj` is permitted, `False`
otherwise. If `obj` is `None`, should return `True` or `False` to
indicate whether deleting objects of this type is permitted in general
(e.g., `False` will be interpreted as meaning that the current user is
not permitted to delete any object of this type).

#### ModelAdmin.has_module_permission(request)

Should return `True` if displaying the module on the admin index page and
accessing the module’s index page is permitted, `False` otherwise.
Uses [`User.has_module_perms()`](../auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.has_module_perms) by default. Overriding
it does not restrict access to the view, add, change, or delete views,
[`has_view_permission()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.has_view_permission),
[`has_add_permission()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.has_add_permission),
[`has_change_permission()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.has_change_permission), and
[`has_delete_permission()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.has_delete_permission) should be used for that.

#### ModelAdmin.get_queryset(request)

The `get_queryset` method on a `ModelAdmin` returns a
[`QuerySet`](../../models/querysets.md#django.db.models.query.QuerySet) of all model instances that
can be edited by the admin site. One use case for overriding this method
is to show objects owned by the logged-in user:

```default
class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def get_queryset(self, request):
        qs = super().get_queryset(request)
        if request.user.is_superuser:
            return qs
        return qs.filter(author=request.user)
```

#### ModelAdmin.message_user(request, message, level=messages.INFO, extra_tags='', fail_silently=False)

Sends a message to the user using the [`django.contrib.messages`](../messages.md#module-django.contrib.messages)
backend. See the [custom ModelAdmin example](actions.md#custom-admin-action).

Keyword arguments allow you to change the message level, add extra CSS
tags, or fail silently if the `contrib.messages` framework is not
installed. These keyword arguments match those for
[`django.contrib.messages.add_message()`](../messages.md#django.contrib.messages.add_message), see that function’s
documentation for more details. One difference is that the level may be
passed as a string label in addition to integer/constant.

#### ModelAdmin.get_paginator(request, queryset, per_page, orphans=0, allow_empty_first_page=True)

Returns an instance of the paginator to use for this view. By default,
instantiates an instance of [`paginator`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.paginator).

#### ModelAdmin.response_add(request, obj, post_url_continue=None)

Determines the [`HttpResponse`](../../request-response.md#django.http.HttpResponse) for the
[`add_view()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.add_view) stage.

`response_add` is called after the admin form is submitted and
just after the object and all the related instances have
been created and saved. You can override it to change the default behavior
after the object has been created.

#### ModelAdmin.response_change(request, obj)

Determines the [`HttpResponse`](../../request-response.md#django.http.HttpResponse) for the
[`change_view()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.change_view) stage.

`response_change` is called after the admin form is submitted and
just after the object and all the related instances have
been saved. You can override it to change the default
behavior after the object has been changed.

#### ModelAdmin.response_delete(request, obj_display, obj_id)

Determines the [`HttpResponse`](../../request-response.md#django.http.HttpResponse) for the
[`delete_view()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.delete_view) stage.

`response_delete` is called after the object has been
deleted. You can override it to change the default
behavior after the object has been deleted.

`obj_display` is a string with the name of the deleted
object.

`obj_id` is the serialized identifier used to retrieve the object to be
deleted.

#### ModelAdmin.get_formset_kwargs(request, obj, inline, prefix)

A hook for customizing the keyword arguments passed to the constructor of a
formset. For example, to pass `request` to formset forms:

```default
class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def get_formset_kwargs(self, request, obj, inline, prefix):
        return {
            **super().get_formset_kwargs(request, obj, inline, prefix),
            "form_kwargs": {"request": request},
        }
```

You can also use it to set `initial` for formset forms.

#### ModelAdmin.get_changeform_initial_data(request)

A hook for the initial data on admin change forms. By default, fields are
given initial values from `GET` parameters. For instance,
`?name=initial_value` will set the `name` field’s initial value to be
`initial_value`.

This method should return a dictionary in the form
`{'fieldname': 'fieldval'}`:

```default
def get_changeform_initial_data(self, request):
    return {"name": "custom_initial_value"}
```

#### ModelAdmin.get_deleted_objects(objs, request)

A hook for customizing the deletion process of the [`delete_view()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.delete_view) and
the “delete selected” [action](actions.md).

The `objs` argument is a homogeneous iterable of objects (a `QuerySet`
or a list of model instances) to be deleted, and `request` is the
[`HttpRequest`](../../request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest).

This method must return a 4-tuple of
`(deleted_objects, model_count, perms_needed, protected)`.

`deleted_objects` is a list of strings representing all the objects that
will be deleted. If there are any related objects to be deleted, the list
is nested and includes those related objects. The list is formatted in the
template using the [`unordered_list`](../../templates/builtins.md#std-templatefilter-unordered_list) filter.

`model_count` is a dictionary mapping each model’s
[`verbose_name_plural`](../../models/options.md#django.db.models.Options.verbose_name_plural) to the number of
objects that will be deleted.

`perms_needed` is a set of
[`verbose_name`](../../models/options.md#django.db.models.Options.verbose_name)s of the models that the
user doesn’t have permission to delete.

`protected` is a list of strings representing of all the protected
related objects that can’t be deleted. The list is displayed in the
template.

#### Other methods

#### ModelAdmin.add_view(request, form_url='', extra_context=None)

Django view for the model instance addition page. See note below.

#### ModelAdmin.change_view(request, object_id, form_url='', extra_context=None)

Django view for the model instance editing page. See note below.

#### ModelAdmin.changelist_view(request, extra_context=None)

Django view for the model instances change list/actions page. See note
below.

#### ModelAdmin.delete_view(request, object_id, extra_context=None)

Django view for the model instance(s) deletion confirmation page. See note
below.

#### ModelAdmin.history_view(request, object_id, extra_context=None)

Django view for the page that shows the modification history for a given
model instance.

Unlike the hook-type `ModelAdmin` methods detailed in the previous section,
these five methods are in reality designed to be invoked as Django views from
the admin application URL dispatching handler to render the pages that deal
with model instances CRUD operations. As a result, completely overriding these
methods will significantly change the behavior of the admin application.

One common reason for overriding these methods is to augment the context data
that is provided to the template that renders the view. In the following
example, the change view is overridden so that the rendered template is
provided some extra mapping data that would not otherwise be available:

```default
class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    # A template for a very customized change view:
    change_form_template = "admin/myapp/extras/openstreetmap_change_form.html"

    def get_osm_info(self):
        # ...
        pass

    def change_view(self, request, object_id, form_url="", extra_context=None):
        extra_context = extra_context or {}
        extra_context["osm_data"] = self.get_osm_info()
        return super().change_view(
            request,
            object_id,
            form_url,
            extra_context=extra_context,
        )
```

These views return [`TemplateResponse`](../../template-response.md#django.template.response.TemplateResponse)
instances which allow you to easily customize the response data before
rendering. For more details, see the [TemplateResponse documentation](../../template-response.md).

<a id="modeladmin-asset-definitions"></a>

### `ModelAdmin` asset definitions

There are times where you would like add a bit of CSS and/or JavaScript to
the add/change views. This can be accomplished by using a `Media` inner class
on your `ModelAdmin`:

```default
class ArticleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    class Media:
        css = {
            "all": ["my_styles.css"],
        }
        js = ["my_code.js"]
```

The [staticfiles app](../staticfiles.md) prepends
[`STATIC_URL`](../../settings.md#std-setting-STATIC_URL) (or [`MEDIA_URL`](../../settings.md#std-setting-MEDIA_URL) if [`STATIC_URL`](../../settings.md#std-setting-STATIC_URL) is
`None`) to any asset paths. The same rules apply as [regular asset
definitions on forms](../../../topics/forms/media.md#form-asset-paths).

<a id="contrib-admin-jquery"></a>

#### jQuery

Django admin JavaScript makes use of the [jQuery](https://jquery.com) library.

To avoid conflicts with user-supplied scripts or libraries, Django’s jQuery
(version 3.7.1) is namespaced as `django.jQuery`. If you want to use jQuery
in your own admin JavaScript without including a second copy, you can use the
`django.jQuery` object on changelist and add/edit views. Also, your own admin
forms or widgets depending on `django.jQuery` must specify
`js=['admin/js/jquery.init.js', …]` when [declaring form media assets](../../../topics/forms/media.md#assets-as-a-static-definition).

The [`ModelAdmin`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin) class requires jQuery by default, so there is no need
to add jQuery to your `ModelAdmin`’s list of media resources unless you have
a specific need. For example, if you require the jQuery library to be in the
global namespace (for example when using third-party jQuery plugins) or if you
need a newer version of jQuery, you will have to include your own copy.

Django provides both uncompressed and ‘minified’ versions of jQuery, as
`jquery.js` and `jquery.min.js` respectively.

[`ModelAdmin`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin) and [`InlineModelAdmin`](#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin) have a `media` property
that returns a list of `Media` objects which store paths to the JavaScript
files for the forms and/or formsets. If [`DEBUG`](../../settings.md#std-setting-DEBUG) is `True` it will
return the uncompressed versions of the various JavaScript files, including
`jquery.js`; if not, it will return the ‘minified’ versions.

<a id="admin-custom-validation"></a>

### Adding custom validation to the admin

You can also add custom validation of data in the admin. The automatic admin
interface reuses [`django.forms`](../../forms/api.md#module-django.forms), and the `ModelAdmin` class gives you
the ability to define your own form:

```default
class ArticleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    form = MyArticleAdminForm
```

`MyArticleAdminForm` can be defined anywhere as long as you import where
needed. Now within your form you can add your own custom validation for
any field:

```default
class MyArticleAdminForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def clean_name(self):
        # do something that validates your data
        return self.cleaned_data["name"]
```

It is important you use a `ModelForm` here otherwise things can break. See
the [forms](../../forms/index.md) documentation on [custom validation](../../forms/validation.md) and, more specifically, the
[model form validation notes](../../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#overriding-modelform-clean-method) for more
information.

<a id="admin-inlines"></a>

## `InlineModelAdmin` objects

### *class* InlineModelAdmin

### *class* TabularInline

### *class* StackedInline

The admin interface has the ability to edit models on the same page as a
parent model. These are called inlines. Suppose you have these two models:

```default
from django.db import models


class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)


class Book(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
```

You can edit the books authored by an author on the author page. You add
inlines to a model by specifying them in a `ModelAdmin.inlines`:

```default
from django.contrib import admin
from myapp.models import Author, Book


class BookInline(admin.TabularInline):
    model = Book


class AuthorAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    inlines = [
        BookInline,
    ]


admin.site.register(Author, AuthorAdmin)
```

Django provides two subclasses of `InlineModelAdmin` and they are:

* [`TabularInline`](#django.contrib.admin.TabularInline)
* [`StackedInline`](#django.contrib.admin.StackedInline)

The difference between these two is merely the template used to render
them.

### `InlineModelAdmin` options

`InlineModelAdmin` shares many of the same features as `ModelAdmin`, and
adds some of its own (the shared features are actually defined in the
`BaseModelAdmin` superclass). The shared features are:

- [`form`](#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin.form)
- [`fieldsets`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fieldsets)
- [`fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fields)
- [`formfield_overrides`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.formfield_overrides)
- [`exclude`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.exclude)
- [`filter_horizontal`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.filter_horizontal)
- [`filter_vertical`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.filter_vertical)
- [`ordering`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.ordering)
- [`prepopulated_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.prepopulated_fields)
- [`get_fieldsets()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_fieldsets)
- [`get_queryset()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_queryset)
- [`radio_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.radio_fields)
- [`readonly_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.readonly_fields)
- [`raw_id_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin.raw_id_fields)
- [`formfield_for_choice_field()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.formfield_for_choice_field)
- [`formfield_for_foreignkey()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.formfield_for_foreignkey)
- [`formfield_for_manytomany()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.formfield_for_manytomany)
- [`has_module_permission()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.has_module_permission)

The `InlineModelAdmin` class adds or customizes:

#### InlineModelAdmin.model

The model which the inline is using. This is required.

#### InlineModelAdmin.fk_name

The name of the foreign key on the model. In most cases this will be dealt
with automatically, but `fk_name` must be specified explicitly if there
are more than one foreign key to the same parent model.

#### InlineModelAdmin.formset

This defaults to [`BaseInlineFormSet`](../../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#django.forms.models.BaseInlineFormSet). Using
your own formset can give you many possibilities of customization. Inlines
are built around [model formsets](../../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#model-formsets).

#### InlineModelAdmin.form

The value for `form` defaults to `ModelForm`. This is what is passed
through to [`inlineformset_factory()`](../../forms/models.md#django.forms.models.inlineformset_factory) when
creating the formset for this inline.

#### WARNING
When writing custom validation for `InlineModelAdmin` forms, be cautious
of writing validation that relies on features of the parent model. If the
parent model fails to validate, it may be left in an inconsistent state as
described in the warning in [Validation on a ModelForm](../../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#validation-on-modelform).

#### InlineModelAdmin.classes

A list or tuple containing extra CSS classes to apply to the fieldset that
is rendered for the inlines. Defaults to `None`. As with classes
configured in [`fieldsets`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.fieldsets), inlines with a `collapse`
class will be initially collapsed using an expandable widget.

#### InlineModelAdmin.extra

This controls the number of extra forms the formset will display in
addition to the initial forms. Defaults to 3. See the
[formsets documentation](../../../topics/forms/formsets.md) for more
information.

For users with JavaScript-enabled browsers, an “Add another” link is
provided to enable any number of additional inlines to be added in addition
to those provided as a result of the `extra` argument.

The dynamic link will not appear if the number of currently displayed forms
exceeds `max_num`, or if the user does not have JavaScript enabled.

[`InlineModelAdmin.get_extra()`](#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin.get_extra) also allows you to customize the number
of extra forms.

#### InlineModelAdmin.max_num

This controls the maximum number of forms to show in the inline. This
doesn’t directly correlate to the number of objects, but can if the value
is small enough. See [Limiting the number of editable objects](../../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#model-formsets-max-num) for more information.

[`InlineModelAdmin.get_max_num()`](#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin.get_max_num) also allows you to customize the
maximum number of extra forms.

#### InlineModelAdmin.min_num

This controls the minimum number of forms to show in the inline.
See [`modelformset_factory()`](../../forms/models.md#django.forms.models.modelformset_factory) for more information.

[`InlineModelAdmin.get_min_num()`](#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin.get_min_num) also allows you to customize the
minimum number of displayed forms.

#### InlineModelAdmin.raw_id_fields

By default, Django’s admin uses a select-box interface (<select>) for
fields that are `ForeignKey`. Sometimes you don’t want to incur the
overhead of having to select all the related instances to display in the
drop-down.

`raw_id_fields` is a list of fields you would like to change into an
`Input` widget for either a `ForeignKey` or `ManyToManyField`:

```default
class BookInline(admin.TabularInline):
    model = Book
    raw_id_fields = ["pages"]
```

#### InlineModelAdmin.template

The template used to render the inline on the page.

#### InlineModelAdmin.verbose_name

An override to the [`verbose_name`](../../models/options.md#django.db.models.Options.verbose_name) from the
model’s inner `Meta` class.

#### InlineModelAdmin.verbose_name_plural

An override to the [`verbose_name_plural`](../../models/options.md#django.db.models.Options.verbose_name_plural)
from the model’s inner `Meta` class. If this isn’t given and the
[`InlineModelAdmin.verbose_name`](#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin.verbose_name) is defined, Django will use
[`InlineModelAdmin.verbose_name`](#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin.verbose_name) + `'s'`.

#### InlineModelAdmin.can_delete

Specifies whether or not inline objects can be deleted in the inline.
Defaults to `True`.

#### InlineModelAdmin.show_change_link

Specifies whether or not inline objects that can be changed in the
admin have a link to the change form. Defaults to `False`.

#### InlineModelAdmin.get_formset(request, obj=None, \*\*kwargs)

Returns a [`BaseInlineFormSet`](../../../topics/forms/modelforms.md#django.forms.models.BaseInlineFormSet) class for use in
admin add/change views. `obj` is the parent object being edited or
`None` when adding a new parent. See the example for
[`ModelAdmin.get_formsets_with_inlines`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_formsets_with_inlines).

#### InlineModelAdmin.get_extra(request, obj=None, \*\*kwargs)

Returns the number of extra inline forms to use. By default, returns the
[`InlineModelAdmin.extra`](#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin.extra) attribute.

Override this method to programmatically determine the number of extra
inline forms. For example, this may be based on the model instance
(passed as the keyword argument `obj`):

```default
class BinaryTreeAdmin(admin.TabularInline):
    model = BinaryTree

    def get_extra(self, request, obj=None, **kwargs):
        extra = 2
        if obj:
            return extra - obj.binarytree_set.count()
        return extra
```

#### InlineModelAdmin.get_max_num(request, obj=None, \*\*kwargs)

Returns the maximum number of extra inline forms to use. By default,
returns the [`InlineModelAdmin.max_num`](#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin.max_num) attribute.

Override this method to programmatically determine the maximum number of
inline forms. For example, this may be based on the model instance
(passed as the keyword argument `obj`):

```default
class BinaryTreeAdmin(admin.TabularInline):
    model = BinaryTree

    def get_max_num(self, request, obj=None, **kwargs):
        max_num = 10
        if obj and obj.parent:
            return max_num - 5
        return max_num
```

#### InlineModelAdmin.get_min_num(request, obj=None, \*\*kwargs)

Returns the minimum number of inline forms to use. By default,
returns the [`InlineModelAdmin.min_num`](#django.contrib.admin.InlineModelAdmin.min_num) attribute.

Override this method to programmatically determine the minimum number of
inline forms. For example, this may be based on the model instance
(passed as the keyword argument `obj`).

#### InlineModelAdmin.has_add_permission(request, obj)

Should return `True` if adding an inline object is permitted, `False`
otherwise. `obj` is the parent object being edited or `None` when
adding a new parent.

#### InlineModelAdmin.has_change_permission(request, obj=None)

Should return `True` if editing an inline object is permitted, `False`
otherwise. `obj` is the parent object being edited.

#### InlineModelAdmin.has_delete_permission(request, obj=None)

Should return `True` if deleting an inline object is permitted, `False`
otherwise. `obj` is the parent object being edited.

#### NOTE
The `obj` argument passed to `InlineModelAdmin` methods is the parent
object being edited or `None` when adding a new parent.

### Working with a model with two or more foreign keys to the same parent model

It is sometimes possible to have more than one foreign key to the same model.
Take this model for instance:

```default
from django.db import models


class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)


class Friendship(models.Model):
    to_person = models.ForeignKey(
        Person, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="friends"
    )
    from_person = models.ForeignKey(
        Person, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="from_friends"
    )
```

If you wanted to display an inline on the `Person` admin add/change pages
you need to explicitly define the foreign key since it is unable to do so
automatically:

```default
from django.contrib import admin
from myapp.models import Friendship, Person


class FriendshipInline(admin.TabularInline):
    model = Friendship
    fk_name = "to_person"


class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    inlines = [
        FriendshipInline,
    ]


admin.site.register(Person, PersonAdmin)
```

### Working with many-to-many models

By default, admin widgets for many-to-many relations will be displayed
on whichever model contains the actual reference to the
[`ManyToManyField`](../../models/fields.md#django.db.models.ManyToManyField). Depending on your `ModelAdmin`
definition, each many-to-many field in your model will be represented by a
standard HTML `<select multiple>`, a horizontal or vertical filter, or a
`raw_id_fields` widget. However, it is also possible to replace these
widgets with inlines.

Suppose we have the following models:

```default
from django.db import models


class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)


class Group(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    members = models.ManyToManyField(Person, related_name="groups")
```

If you want to display many-to-many relations using an inline, you can do
so by defining an `InlineModelAdmin` object for the relationship:

```default
from django.contrib import admin
from myapp.models import Group


class MembershipInline(admin.TabularInline):
    model = Group.members.through


class GroupAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    inlines = [
        MembershipInline,
    ]
    exclude = ["members"]


admin.site.register(Group, GroupAdmin)
```

There are two features worth noting in this example.

Firstly - the `MembershipInline` class references `Group.members.through`.
The `through` attribute is a reference to the model that manages the
many-to-many relation. This model is automatically created by Django when you
define a many-to-many field.

Secondly, the `GroupAdmin` must manually exclude the `members` field.
Django displays an admin widget for a many-to-many field on the model that
defines the relation (in this case, `Group`). If you want to use an inline
model to represent the many-to-many relationship, you must tell Django’s admin
to *not* display this widget - otherwise you will end up with two widgets on
your admin page for managing the relation.

Note that when using this technique the
[`m2m_changed`](../../signals.md#django.db.models.signals.m2m_changed) signals aren’t triggered. This
is because as far as the admin is concerned, `through` is just a model with
two foreign key fields rather than a many-to-many relation.

In all other respects, the `InlineModelAdmin` is exactly the same as any
other. You can customize the appearance using any of the normal
`ModelAdmin` properties.

### Working with many-to-many intermediary models

When you specify an intermediary model using the `through` argument to a
[`ManyToManyField`](../../models/fields.md#django.db.models.ManyToManyField), the admin will not display a
widget by default. This is because each instance of that intermediary model
requires more information than could be displayed in a single widget, and the
layout required for multiple widgets will vary depending on the intermediate
model.

However, we still want to be able to edit that information inline. Fortunately,
we can do this with inline admin models. Suppose we have the following models:

```default
from django.db import models


class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)


class Group(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    members = models.ManyToManyField(Person, through="Membership")


class Membership(models.Model):
    person = models.ForeignKey(Person, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    group = models.ForeignKey(Group, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    date_joined = models.DateField()
    invite_reason = models.CharField(max_length=64)

    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            models.UniqueConstraint(
                fields=["person", "group"], name="unique_person_group"
            )
        ]
```

The first step in displaying this intermediate model in the admin is to
define an inline class for the `Membership` model:

```default
class MembershipInline(admin.TabularInline):
    model = Membership
    extra = 1
```

This example uses the default `InlineModelAdmin` values for the
`Membership` model, and limits the extra add forms to one. This could be
customized using any of the options available to `InlineModelAdmin` classes.

Now create admin views for the `Person` and `Group` models:

```default
class PersonAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    inlines = [MembershipInline]


class GroupAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    inlines = [MembershipInline]
```

Finally, register your `Person` and `Group` models with the admin site:

```default
admin.site.register(Person, PersonAdmin)
admin.site.register(Group, GroupAdmin)
```

Now your admin site is set up to edit `Membership` objects inline from
either the `Person` or the `Group` detail pages.

<a id="using-generic-relations-as-an-inline"></a>

### Using generic relations as an inline

It is possible to use an inline with generically related objects. Let’s say
you have the following models:

```default
from django.contrib.contenttypes.fields import GenericForeignKey
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
from django.db import models


class Image(models.Model):
    image = models.ImageField(upload_to="images")
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    content_object = GenericForeignKey("content_type", "object_id")


class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
```

If you want to allow editing and creating an `Image` instance on the
`Product`, add/change views you can use
[`GenericTabularInline`](../contenttypes.md#django.contrib.contenttypes.admin.GenericTabularInline)
or [`GenericStackedInline`](../contenttypes.md#django.contrib.contenttypes.admin.GenericStackedInline) (both
subclasses of
[`GenericInlineModelAdmin`](../contenttypes.md#django.contrib.contenttypes.admin.GenericInlineModelAdmin))
provided by [`admin`](../contenttypes.md#module-django.contrib.contenttypes.admin). They implement tabular
and stacked visual layouts for the forms representing the inline objects,
respectively, just like their non-generic counterparts. They behave just like
any other inline. In your `admin.py` for this example app:

```default
from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.contenttypes.admin import GenericTabularInline

from myapp.models import Image, Product


class ImageInline(GenericTabularInline):
    model = Image


class ProductAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    inlines = [
        ImageInline,
    ]


admin.site.register(Product, ProductAdmin)
```

See the [contenttypes documentation](../contenttypes.md) for more
specific information.

<a id="admin-overriding-templates"></a>

## Overriding admin templates

You can override many of the templates which the admin module uses to generate
the various pages of an admin site. You can even override a few of these
templates for a specific app, or a specific model.

### Set up your projects admin template directories

The admin template files are located in the
[django/contrib/admin/templates/admin](https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/contrib/admin/templates/admin) directory.

In order to override one or more of them, first create an `admin` directory
in your project’s `templates` directory. This can be any of the directories
you specified in the [`DIRS`](../../settings.md#std-setting-TEMPLATES-DIRS) option of the
`DjangoTemplates` backend in the [`TEMPLATES`](../../settings.md#std-setting-TEMPLATES) setting. If you have
customized the `'loaders'` option, be sure
`'django.template.loaders.filesystem.Loader'` appears before
`'django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader'` so that your custom
templates will be found by the template loading system before those that are
included with [`django.contrib.admin`](#module-django.contrib.admin).

Within this `admin` directory, create sub-directories named after your app.
Within these app subdirectories create sub-directories named after your models.
Note, that the admin app will lowercase the model name when looking for the
directory, so make sure you name the directory in all lowercase if you are
going to run your app on a case-sensitive filesystem.

To override an admin template for a specific app, copy and edit the template
from the [django/contrib/admin/templates/admin](https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/contrib/admin/templates/admin) directory, and save it
to one of the directories you just created.

For example, if we wanted to add a tool to the change list view for all the
models in an app named `my_app`, we would copy
`contrib/admin/templates/admin/change_list.html` to the
`templates/admin/my_app/` directory of our project, and make any necessary
changes.

If we wanted to add a tool to the change list view for only a specific model
named ‘Page’, we would copy that same file to the
`templates/admin/my_app/page` directory of our project.

### Overriding vs. replacing an admin template

Because of the modular design of the admin templates, it is usually neither
necessary nor advisable to replace an entire template. It is almost always
better to override only the section of the template which you need to change.

To continue the example above, we want to add a new link next to the
`History` tool for the `Page` model. After looking at `change_form.html`
we determine that we only need to override the `object-tools-items` block.
Therefore here is our new `change_form.html` :

```html+django
{% extends "admin/change_form.html" %}
{% load i18n admin_urls %}
{% block object-tools-items %}
    <li>
        <a href="{% url opts|admin_urlname:'history' original.pk|admin_urlquote %}" class="historylink">{% translate "History" %}</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="mylink/" class="historylink">My Link</a>
    </li>
    {% if has_absolute_url %}
        <li>
            <a href="{% url 'admin:view_on_site' content_type_id original.pk %}" class="viewsitelink">{% translate "View on site" %}</a>
        </li>
    {% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```

And that’s it! If we placed this file in the `templates/admin/my_app`
directory, our link would appear on the change form for all models within
my_app.

<a id="admin-templates-overridden-per-app-or-model"></a>

### Templates which may be overridden per app or model

Not every template in `contrib/admin/templates/admin` may be overridden per
app or per model. The following can:

* `actions.html`
* `app_index.html`
* `change_form.html`
* `change_form_object_tools.html`
* `change_list.html`
* `change_list_object_tools.html`
* `change_list_results.html`
* `date_hierarchy.html`
* `delete_confirmation.html`
* `object_history.html`
* `pagination.html`
* `popup_response.html`
* `prepopulated_fields_js.html`
* `search_form.html`
* `submit_line.html`

For those templates that cannot be overridden in this way, you may still
override them for your entire project by placing the new version in your
`templates/admin` directory. This is particularly useful to create custom 404
and 500 pages.

#### NOTE
Some of the admin templates, such as `change_list_results.html` are used
to render custom inclusion tags. These may be overridden, but in such cases
you are probably better off creating your own version of the tag in
question and giving it a different name. That way you can use it
selectively.

### Root and login templates

If you wish to change the index, login or logout templates, you are better off
creating your own `AdminSite` instance (see below), and changing the
[`AdminSite.index_template`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.index_template) , [`AdminSite.login_template`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.login_template) or
[`AdminSite.logout_template`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.logout_template) properties.

<a id="admin-theming"></a>

## Theming support

The admin uses CSS variables to define colors and fonts. This allows changing
themes without having to override many individual CSS rules. For example, if
you preferred purple instead of blue you could add a `admin/base.html`
template override to your project:

```html+django
{% extends 'admin/base.html' %}

{% block extrastyle %}{{ block.super }}
<style>
html[data-theme="light"], :root {
  --primary: #9774d5;
  --secondary: #785cab;
  --link-fg: #7c449b;
  --link-selected-fg: #8f5bb2;
}
</style>
{% endblock %}
```

The list of CSS variables are defined at
[django/contrib/admin/static/admin/css/base.css](https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/contrib/admin/static/admin/css/base.css).

Dark mode variables, respecting the [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) media query, are
defined at [django/contrib/admin/static/admin/css/dark_mode.css](https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/contrib/admin/static/admin/css/dark_mode.css). This
is linked to the document in `{% block dark-mode-vars %}`.

<a id="extrabody"></a>

## `extrabody` block

You can add custom HTML, JavaScript, or other content to appear just before the
closing `</body>` tag of templates that extend `admin/base.html` by
extending the `extrabody` block. For example, if you want an alert to appear
on page load you could add a `admin/base.html` template override to your
project:

```html+django
{% extends 'admin/base.html' %}

{% block extrabody %}
    {{ block.super }}
    <script>
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
            window.alert('Welcome!');
        });
    </script>
{% endblock extrabody %}
```

## `AdminSite` objects

### *class* AdminSite(name='admin')

A Django administrative site is represented by an instance of
`django.contrib.admin.sites.AdminSite`; by default, an instance of
this class is created as `django.contrib.admin.site` and you can
register your models and `ModelAdmin` instances with it.

If you want to customize the default admin site, you can [override it](#overriding-default-admin-site).

When constructing an instance of an `AdminSite`, you can provide
a unique instance name using the `name` argument to the constructor. This
instance name is used to identify the instance, especially when
[reversing admin URLs](#admin-reverse-urls). If no instance name is
provided, a default instance name of `admin` will be used.
See [Customizing the AdminSite class](#customizing-adminsite) for an example of customizing the
[`AdminSite`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite) class.

#### django.contrib.admin.sites.all_sites

A [`WeakSet`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/weakref.html#weakref.WeakSet) contains all admin site instances.

### `AdminSite` attributes

Templates can override or extend base admin templates as described in
[Overriding admin templates](#admin-overriding-templates).

#### AdminSite.site_header

The text to put at the top of each admin page, as a `<div>` (a string).
By default, this is “Django administration”.

#### AdminSite.site_title

The text to put at the end of each admin page’s `<title>` (a string). By
default, this is “Django site admin”.

#### AdminSite.site_url

The URL for the “View site” link at the top of each admin page. By default,
`site_url` is `/`. Set it to `None` to remove the link.

For sites running on a subpath, the [`each_context()`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.each_context) method checks if
the current request has `request.META['SCRIPT_NAME']` set and uses that
value if `site_url` isn’t set to something other than `/`.

#### AdminSite.index_title

The text to put at the top of the admin index page (a string). By default,
this is “Site administration”.

#### AdminSite.index_template

Path to a custom template that will be used by the admin site main index
view.

#### AdminSite.app_index_template

Path to a custom template that will be used by the admin site app index
view.

#### AdminSite.empty_value_display

The string to use for displaying empty values in the admin site’s change
list. Defaults to a dash. The value can also be overridden on a per
`ModelAdmin` basis and on a custom field within a `ModelAdmin` by
setting an `empty_value_display` attribute on the field. See
[`ModelAdmin.empty_value_display`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.empty_value_display) for examples.

#### AdminSite.enable_nav_sidebar

A boolean value that determines whether to show the navigation sidebar
on larger screens. By default, it is set to `True`.

#### AdminSite.final_catch_all_view

A boolean value that determines whether to add a final catch-all view to
the admin that redirects unauthenticated users to the login page. By
default, it is set to `True`.

#### WARNING
Setting this to `False` is not recommended as the view protects
against a potential model enumeration privacy issue.

#### AdminSite.login_template

Path to a custom template that will be used by the admin site login view.

#### AdminSite.login_form

Subclass of [`AuthenticationForm`](../../../topics/auth/default.md#django.contrib.auth.forms.AuthenticationForm) that
will be used by the admin site login view.

#### AdminSite.logout_template

Path to a custom template that will be used by the admin site logout view.

#### AdminSite.password_change_form

#### Versionadded

Subclass of [`PasswordChangeForm`](../../../topics/auth/default.md#django.contrib.auth.forms.PasswordChangeForm) that
will be used by the admin site password change view.

#### AdminSite.password_change_template

Path to a custom template that will be used by the admin site password
change view.

#### AdminSite.password_change_done_template

Path to a custom template that will be used by the admin site password
change done view.

### `AdminSite` methods

#### AdminSite.each_context(request)

Returns a dictionary of variables to put in the template context for
every page in the admin site.

Includes the following variables and values by default:

* `site_header`: [`AdminSite.site_header`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.site_header)
* `site_title`: [`AdminSite.site_title`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.site_title)
* `site_url`: [`AdminSite.site_url`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.site_url)
* `has_permission`: [`AdminSite.has_permission()`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.has_permission)
* `available_apps`: a list of applications from the [application
  registry](../../applications.md) available for the current user. Each entry
  in the list is a dict representing an application with the following
  keys:
  * `app_label`: the application label
  * `app_url`: the URL of the application index in the admin
  * `has_module_perms`: a boolean indicating if displaying and accessing
    of the module’s index page is permitted for the current user
  * `models`: a list of the models available in the application

  Each model is a dict with the following keys:
  * `model`: the model class
  * `object_name`: class name of the model
  * `name`: plural name of the model
  * `perms`: a `dict` tracking `add`, `change`, `delete`, and
    `view` permissions
  * `admin_url`: admin changelist URL for the model
  * `add_url`: admin URL to add a new model instance
* `is_popup`: whether the current page is displayed in a popup window
* `is_nav_sidebar_enabled`: [`AdminSite.enable_nav_sidebar`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.enable_nav_sidebar)
* `log_entries`: [`AdminSite.get_log_entries()`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.get_log_entries)

#### AdminSite.get_app_list(request, app_label=None)

Returns a list of applications from the [application registry](../../applications.md) available for the current user. You can optionally
pass an `app_label` argument to get details for a single app. Each entry
in the list is a dictionary representing an application with the following
keys:

* `app_label`: the application label
* `app_url`: the URL of the application index in the admin
* `has_module_perms`: a boolean indicating if displaying and accessing of
  the module’s index page is permitted for the current user
* `models`: a list of the models available in the application
* `name`: name of the application

Each model is a dictionary with the following keys:

* `model`: the model class
* `object_name`: class name of the model
* `name`: plural name of the model
* `perms`: a `dict` tracking `add`, `change`, `delete`, and
  `view` permissions
* `admin_url`: admin changelist URL for the model
* `add_url`: admin URL to add a new model instance

Lists of applications and models are sorted alphabetically by their names.
You can override this method to change the default order on the admin index
page.

#### AdminSite.has_permission(request)

Returns `True` if the user for the given `HttpRequest` has permission
to view at least one page in the admin site. Defaults to requiring both
[`User.is_active`](../auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.is_active) and
[`User.is_staff`](../auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.is_staff) to be
`True`.

#### AdminSite.register(model_or_iterable, admin_class=None, \*\*options)

Registers the given model class (or iterable of classes) with the given
`admin_class`. `admin_class` defaults to
[`ModelAdmin`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin) (the default admin options). If
keyword arguments are given – e.g. `list_display` – they’ll be applied
as options to the admin class.

Raises [`ImproperlyConfigured`](../../exceptions.md#django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured) if a model is
abstract. and `django.contrib.admin.exceptions.AlreadyRegistered` if a
model is already registered.

#### AdminSite.unregister(model_or_iterable)

Unregisters the given model class (or iterable of classes).

Raises `django.contrib.admin.exceptions.NotRegistered` if a model isn’t
already registered.

#### AdminSite.get_model_admin(model)

Returns an admin class for the given model class. Raises
`django.contrib.admin.exceptions.NotRegistered` if a model isn’t
registered.

#### AdminSite.get_log_entries(request)

Returns a queryset for the related
[`LogEntry`](#django.contrib.admin.models.LogEntry) instances, shown on the site
index page. This method can be overridden to filter the log entries by
other criteria.

<a id="hooking-adminsite-to-urlconf"></a>

### Hooking `AdminSite` instances into your URLconf

The last step in setting up the Django admin is to hook your `AdminSite`
instance into your URLconf. Do this by pointing a given URL at the
`AdminSite.urls` method. It is not necessary to use
[`include()`](../../urls.md#django.urls.include).

In this example, we register the default `AdminSite` instance
`django.contrib.admin.site` at the URL `/admin/`

```default
# urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
]
```

<a id="customizing-adminsite"></a>

### Customizing the [`AdminSite`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite) class

If you’d like to set up your own admin site with custom behavior, you’re free
to subclass `AdminSite` and override or add anything you like. Then, create
an instance of your `AdminSite` subclass (the same way you’d instantiate any
other Python class) and register your models and `ModelAdmin` subclasses with
it instead of with the default site. Finally, update `myproject/urls.py`
to reference your [`AdminSite`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite) subclass.

```python
from django.contrib import admin

from .models import MyModel


class MyAdminSite(admin.AdminSite):
    site_header = "Monty Python administration"


admin_site = MyAdminSite(name="myadmin")
admin_site.register(MyModel)
```

```python
from django.urls import path

from myapp.admin import admin_site

urlpatterns = [
    path("myadmin/", admin_site.urls),
]
```

Note that you may not want autodiscovery of `admin` modules when using your
own `AdminSite` instance since you will likely be importing all the per-app
`admin` modules in your `myproject.admin` module. This means you need to
put `'django.contrib.admin.apps.SimpleAdminConfig'` instead of
`'django.contrib.admin'` in your [`INSTALLED_APPS`](../../settings.md#std-setting-INSTALLED_APPS) setting.

<a id="overriding-default-admin-site"></a>

### Overriding the default admin site

You can override the default `django.contrib.admin.site` by setting the
[`default_site`](#django.contrib.admin.apps.SimpleAdminConfig.default_site) attribute of a custom `AppConfig`
to the dotted import path of either a `AdminSite` subclass or a callable that
returns a site instance.

```python
from django.contrib import admin


class MyAdminSite(admin.AdminSite): ...
```

```python
from django.contrib.admin.apps import AdminConfig


class MyAdminConfig(AdminConfig):
    default_site = "myproject.admin.MyAdminSite"
```

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "myproject.apps.MyAdminConfig",  # replaces 'django.contrib.admin'
    # ...
]
```

<a id="multiple-admin-sites"></a>

### Multiple admin sites in the same URLconf

You can create multiple instances of the admin site on the same Django-powered
website. Create multiple instances of `AdminSite` and place each one at a
different URL.

In this example, the URLs `/basic-admin/` and `/advanced-admin/` feature
separate versions of the admin site – using the `AdminSite` instances
`myproject.admin.basic_site` and `myproject.admin.advanced_site`,
respectively:

```default
# urls.py
from django.urls import path
from myproject.admin import advanced_site, basic_site

urlpatterns = [
    path("basic-admin/", basic_site.urls),
    path("advanced-admin/", advanced_site.urls),
]
```

`AdminSite` instances take a single argument to their constructor, their
name, which can be anything you like. This argument becomes the prefix to the
URL names for the purposes of [reversing them](#admin-reverse-urls). This
is only necessary if you are using more than one `AdminSite`.

### Adding views to admin sites

Just like [`ModelAdmin`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin), [`AdminSite`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite) provides a
[`get_urls()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_urls) method
that can be overridden to define additional views for the site. To add
a new view to your admin site, extend the base
[`get_urls()`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.get_urls) method to include
a pattern for your new view.

#### NOTE
Any view you render that uses the admin templates, or extends the base
admin template, should set `request.current_app` before rendering the
template. It should be set to either `self.name` if your view is on an
`AdminSite` or `self.admin_site.name` if your view is on a
`ModelAdmin`.

<a id="auth-password-reset"></a>

### Adding a password reset feature

You can add a password reset feature to the admin site by adding a few lines to
your URLconf. Specifically, add these four patterns:

```default
from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views

path(
    "admin/password_reset/",
    auth_views.PasswordResetView.as_view(
        extra_context={"site_header": admin.site.site_header}
    ),
    name="admin_password_reset",
),
path(
    "admin/password_reset/done/",
    auth_views.PasswordResetDoneView.as_view(
        extra_context={"site_header": admin.site.site_header}
    ),
    name="password_reset_done",
),
path(
    "reset/<uidb64>/<token>/",
    auth_views.PasswordResetConfirmView.as_view(
        extra_context={"site_header": admin.site.site_header}
    ),
    name="password_reset_confirm",
),
path(
    "reset/done/",
    auth_views.PasswordResetCompleteView.as_view(
        extra_context={"site_header": admin.site.site_header}
    ),
    name="password_reset_complete",
),
```

(This assumes you’ve added the admin at `admin/` and requires that you put
the URLs starting with `^admin/` before the line that includes the admin app
itself).

The presence of the `admin_password_reset` named URL will cause a “forgotten
your password?” link to appear on the default admin log-in page under the
password box.

## `LogEntry` objects

#### *class* models.LogEntry

The `LogEntry` class tracks additions, changes, and deletions of objects
done through the admin interface.

### `LogEntry` attributes

#### LogEntry.action_time

The date and time of the action.

#### LogEntry.user

The user (an [`AUTH_USER_MODEL`](../../settings.md#std-setting-AUTH_USER_MODEL) instance) who performed the
action.

#### LogEntry.content_type

The [`ContentType`](../contenttypes.md#django.contrib.contenttypes.models.ContentType) of the
modified object.

#### LogEntry.object_id

The textual representation of the modified object’s primary key.

#### LogEntry.object_repr

The object\`s `repr()` after the modification.

#### LogEntry.action_flag

The type of action logged: `ADDITION`, `CHANGE`, `DELETION`.

For example, to get a list of all additions done through the admin:

```default
from django.contrib.admin.models import ADDITION, LogEntry

LogEntry.objects.filter(action_flag=ADDITION)
```

#### LogEntry.change_message

The detailed description of the modification. In the case of an edit, for
example, the message contains a list of the edited fields. The Django admin
site formats this content as a JSON structure, so that
[`get_change_message()`](#django.contrib.admin.models.LogEntry.get_change_message) can recompose a message translated in the
current user language. Custom code might set this as a plain string though.
You are advised to use the [`get_change_message()`](#django.contrib.admin.models.LogEntry.get_change_message) method to retrieve
this value instead of accessing it directly.

### `LogEntry` methods

#### LogEntry.get_edited_object()

A shortcut that returns the referenced object.

#### LogEntry.get_change_message()

Formats and translates [`change_message`](#django.contrib.admin.models.LogEntry.change_message) into the current user
language. Messages created before Django 1.10 will always be displayed in
the language in which they were logged.

<a id="admin-reverse-urls"></a>

## Reversing admin URLs

When an [`AdminSite`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite) is deployed, the views provided by that site are
accessible using Django’s [URL reversing system](../../../topics/http/urls.md#naming-url-patterns).

The [`AdminSite`](#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite) provides the following named URL patterns:

| Page                      | URL name               | Parameters                     |
|---------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Index                     | `index`                |                                |
| Login                     | `login`                |                                |
| Logout                    | `logout`               |                                |
| Password change           | `password_change`      |                                |
| Password change done      | `password_change_done` |                                |
| i18n JavaScript           | `jsi18n`               |                                |
| Application index page    | `app_list`             | `app_label`                    |
| Redirect to object’s page | `view_on_site`         | `content_type_id`, `object_id` |

Each [`ModelAdmin`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin) instance provides an additional set of named URLs:

| Page       | URL name                                      | Parameters   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Changelist | `{{ app_label }}_{{ model_name }}_changelist` |              |
| Add        | `{{ app_label }}_{{ model_name }}_add`        |              |
| History    | `{{ app_label }}_{{ model_name }}_history`    | `object_id`  |
| Delete     | `{{ app_label }}_{{ model_name }}_delete`     | `object_id`  |
| Change     | `{{ app_label }}_{{ model_name }}_change`     | `object_id`  |

The `UserAdmin` provides a named URL:

| Page            | URL name                    | Parameters   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| Password change | `auth_user_password_change` | `user_id`    |

These named URLs are registered with the application namespace `admin`, and
with an instance namespace corresponding to the name of the Site instance.

So - if you wanted to get a reference to the Change view for a particular
`Choice` object (from the polls application) in the default admin, you would
call:

```pycon
>>> from django.urls import reverse
>>> c = Choice.objects.get(...)
>>> change_url = reverse("admin:polls_choice_change", args=(c.id,))
```

This will find the first registered instance of the admin application
(whatever the instance name), and resolve to the view for changing
`poll.Choice` instances in that instance.

If you want to find a URL in a specific admin instance, provide the name of
that instance as a `current_app` hint to the reverse call. For example,
if you specifically wanted the admin view from the admin instance named
`custom`, you would need to call:

```pycon
>>> change_url = reverse("admin:polls_choice_change", args=(c.id,), current_app="custom")
```

For more details, see the documentation on [reversing namespaced URLs](../../../topics/http/urls.md#topics-http-reversing-url-namespaces).

To allow easier reversing of the admin urls in templates, Django provides an
`admin_urlname` filter which takes an action as argument:

```html+django
{% load admin_urls %}
<a href="{% url opts|admin_urlname:'add' %}">Add user</a>
<a href="{% url opts|admin_urlname:'delete' user.pk %}">Delete this user</a>
```

The action in the examples above match the last part of the URL names for
[`ModelAdmin`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin) instances described above. The `opts` variable can be any
object which has an `app_label` and `model_name` attributes and is usually
supplied by the admin views for the current model.

## The `display` decorator

### display(, boolean=None, ordering=None, description=None, empty_value=None)

This decorator can be used for setting specific attributes on custom
display functions that can be used with
[`list_display`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display) or
[`readonly_fields`](#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.readonly_fields):

```default
@admin.display(
    boolean=True,
    ordering="-publish_date",
    description="Is Published?",
)
def is_published(self, obj):
    return obj.publish_date is not None
```

This is equivalent to setting some attributes (with the original, longer
names) on the function directly:

```default
def is_published(self, obj):
    return obj.publish_date is not None


is_published.boolean = True
is_published.admin_order_field = "-publish_date"
is_published.short_description = "Is Published?"
```

Also note that the `empty_value` decorator parameter maps to the
`empty_value_display` attribute assigned directly to the function. It
cannot be used in conjunction with `boolean` – they are mutually
exclusive.

Use of this decorator is not compulsory to make a display function, but it
can be useful to use it without arguments as a marker in your source to
identify the purpose of the function:

```default
@admin.display
def published_year(self, obj):
    return obj.publish_date.year
```

In this case it will add no attributes to the function.

## The `staff_member_required` decorator

### staff_member_required(redirect_field_name='next', login_url='admin:login')

This decorator is used on the admin views that require authorization. A
view decorated with this function will have the following behavior:

* If the user is logged in, is a staff member (`User.is_staff=True`), and
  is active (`User.is_active=True`), execute the view normally.
* Otherwise, the request will be redirected to the URL specified by the
  `login_url` parameter, with the originally requested path in a query
  string variable specified by `redirect_field_name`. For example:
  `/admin/login/?next=/admin/polls/question/3/`.

Example usage:

```default
from django.contrib.admin.views.decorators import staff_member_required


@staff_member_required
def my_view(request): ...
```
