# `django.urls` functions for use in URLconfs

## `path()`

### path(route, view, kwargs=None, name=None)

Returns an element for inclusion in `urlpatterns`. For example:

```default
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path("index/", views.index, name="main-view"),
    path("bio/<username>/", views.bio, name="bio"),
    path("articles/<slug:title>/", views.article, name="article-detail"),
    path("articles/<slug:title>/<int:section>/", views.section, name="article-section"),
    path("blog/", include("blog.urls")),
    ...,
]
```

### `route`

The `route` argument should be a string or
[`gettext_lazy()`](utils.md#django.utils.translation.gettext_lazy) (see
[Translating URL patterns](../topics/i18n/translation.md#translating-urlpatterns)) that contains a URL pattern. The string
may contain angle brackets (like `<username>` above) to capture part of the
URL and send it as a keyword argument to the view. The angle brackets may
include a converter specification (like the `int` part of `<int:section>`)
which limits the characters matched and may also change the type of the
variable passed to the view. For example, `<int:section>` matches a string
of decimal digits and converts the value to an `int`.

When processing a request, Django starts at the first pattern in
`urlpatterns` and makes its way down the list, comparing the requested URL
against each pattern until it finds one that matches. See
[How Django processes a request](../topics/http/urls.md#how-django-processes-a-request) for more details.

Patterns don’t match GET and POST parameters, or the domain name. For example,
in a request to `https://www.example.com/myapp/`, the URLconf will look for
`myapp/`. In a request to `https://www.example.com/myapp/?page=3`, the
URLconf will also look for `myapp/`.

### `view`

The `view` argument is a view function or the result of
[`as_view()`](class-based-views/base.md#django.views.generic.base.View.as_view) for class-based views. It can
also be a [`django.urls.include()`](#django.urls.include).

When Django finds a matching pattern, it calls the specified view function with
an [`HttpRequest`](request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest) object as the first argument and any
“captured” values from the route as keyword arguments.

### `kwargs`

The `kwargs` argument allows you to pass additional arguments to the view
function or method. See [Passing extra options to view functions](../topics/http/urls.md#views-extra-options) for an example.

### `name`

Naming your URL lets you refer to it unambiguously from elsewhere in Django,
especially from within templates. This powerful feature allows you to make
global changes to the URL patterns of your project while only touching a single
file.

See [Naming URL patterns](../topics/http/urls.md#naming-url-patterns) for why the `name`
argument is useful.

## `re_path()`

### re_path(route, view, kwargs=None, name=None)

Returns an element for inclusion in `urlpatterns`. For example:

```default
from django.urls import include, re_path

urlpatterns = [
    re_path(r"^index/$", views.index, name="index"),
    re_path(r"^bio/(?P<username>\w+)/$", views.bio, name="bio"),
    re_path(r"^blog/", include("blog.urls")),
    ...,
]
```

The `route` argument should be a string or
[`gettext_lazy()`](utils.md#django.utils.translation.gettext_lazy) (see
[Translating URL patterns](../topics/i18n/translation.md#translating-urlpatterns)) that contains a regular expression compatible
with Python’s [`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re) module. Strings typically use raw string syntax
(`r''`) so that they can contain sequences like `\d` without the need to
escape the backslash with another backslash. When a match is made, captured
groups from the regular expression are passed to the view – as named arguments
if the groups are named, and as positional arguments otherwise. The values are
passed as strings, without any type conversion.

When a `route` ends with `$` the whole requested URL, matching against
[`path_info`](request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest.path_info), must match the regular expression
pattern ([`re.fullmatch()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.fullmatch) is used).

The `view`, `kwargs` and `name` arguments are the same as for
[`path()`](#django.urls.path).

## `include()`

### include(module, namespace=None)

### include(pattern_list)

### include((pattern_list, app_namespace), namespace=None)

A function that takes a full Python import path to another URLconf module
that should be “included” in this place. Optionally, the [application
namespace](../topics/http/urls.md#term-application-namespace) and [instance namespace](../topics/http/urls.md#term-instance-namespace) where the entries will be
included into can also be specified.

Usually, the application namespace should be specified by the included
module. If an application namespace is set, the `namespace` argument
can be used to set a different instance namespace.

`include()` also accepts as an argument either an iterable that returns
URL patterns or a 2-tuple containing such iterable plus the names of the
application namespaces.

* **Parameters:**
  * **module** – URLconf module (or module name)
  * **namespace** ([*str*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)) – Instance namespace for the URL entries being included
  * **pattern_list** – Iterable of [`path()`](#django.urls.path)
    and/or [`re_path()`](#django.urls.re_path) instances.
  * **app_namespace** ([*str*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)) – Application namespace for the URL entries being
    included

See [Including other URLconfs](../topics/http/urls.md#including-other-urlconfs) and [URL namespaces and included URLconfs](../topics/http/urls.md#namespaces-and-include).

## `register_converter()`

### register_converter(converter, type_name)

The function for registering a converter for use in [`path()`](#django.urls.path)
`route`s.

The `converter` argument is a converter class, and `type_name` is the
converter name to use in path patterns. See
[Registering custom path converters](../topics/http/urls.md#registering-custom-path-converters) for an example.

# `django.conf.urls` functions for use in URLconfs

## `static()`

#### static.static(prefix, view=django.views.static.serve, \*\*kwargs)

Helper function to return a URL pattern for serving files in debug mode:

```default
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    # ... the rest of your URLconf goes here ...
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

## `handler400`

### handler400

A callable, or a string representing the full Python import path to the view
that should be called if the HTTP client has sent a request that caused an
error condition and a response with a status code of 400.

By default, this is [`django.views.defaults.bad_request()`](views.md#django.views.defaults.bad_request). If you
implement a custom view, be sure it accepts `request` and `exception`
arguments and returns an [`HttpResponseBadRequest`](request-response.md#django.http.HttpResponseBadRequest).

## `handler403`

### handler403

A callable, or a string representing the full Python import path to the view
that should be called if the user doesn’t have the permissions required to
access a resource.

By default, this is [`django.views.defaults.permission_denied()`](views.md#django.views.defaults.permission_denied). If you
implement a custom view, be sure it accepts `request` and `exception`
arguments and returns an [`HttpResponseForbidden`](request-response.md#django.http.HttpResponseForbidden).

## `handler404`

### handler404

A callable, or a string representing the full Python import path to the view
that should be called if none of the URL patterns match.

By default, this is [`django.views.defaults.page_not_found()`](views.md#django.views.defaults.page_not_found). If you
implement a custom view, be sure it accepts `request` and `exception`
arguments and returns an [`HttpResponseNotFound`](request-response.md#django.http.HttpResponseNotFound).

## `handler500`

### handler500

A callable, or a string representing the full Python import path to the view
that should be called in case of server errors. Server errors happen when you
have runtime errors in view code.

By default, this is [`django.views.defaults.server_error()`](views.md#django.views.defaults.server_error). If you
implement a custom view, be sure it accepts a `request` argument and returns
an [`HttpResponseServerError`](request-response.md#django.http.HttpResponseServerError).
