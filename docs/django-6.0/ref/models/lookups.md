# Lookup API reference

This document has the API references of lookups, the Django API for building
the `WHERE` clause of a database query. To learn how to *use* lookups, see
[Making queries](../../topics/db/queries.md); to learn how to *create* new lookups, see
[How to write custom lookups](../../howto/custom-lookups.md).

The lookup API has two components: a [`RegisterLookupMixin`](#django.db.models.lookups.RegisterLookupMixin)
class that registers lookups, and the [Query Expression API](#query-expression), a set of methods that a class has to implement to be
registrable as a lookup.

Django has two base classes that follow the query expression API and from where
all Django builtin lookups are derived:

* [`Lookup`](#django.db.models.Lookup): to lookup a field (e.g. the `exact` of
  `field_name__exact`)
* [`Transform`](#django.db.models.Transform): to transform a field

A lookup expression consists of three parts:

* Fields part (e.g.
  `Book.objects.filter(author__best_friends__first_name...`);
* Transforms part (may be omitted) (e.g. `__lower__first3chars__reversed`);
* A lookup (e.g. `__icontains`) that, if omitted, defaults to `__exact`.

## Registration API

Django uses [`RegisterLookupMixin`](#django.db.models.lookups.RegisterLookupMixin) to give a class the interface
to register lookups on itself or its instances. The two prominent examples are
[`Field`](fields.md#django.db.models.Field), the base class of all model fields, and
[`Transform`](#django.db.models.Transform), the base class of all Django transforms.

#### *class* lookups.RegisterLookupMixin

A mixin that implements the lookup API on a class.

#### *classmethod* register_lookup(lookup, lookup_name=None)

Registers a new lookup in the class or class instance. For example:

```default
DateField.register_lookup(YearExact)
User._meta.get_field("date_joined").register_lookup(MonthExact)
```

will register `YearExact` lookup on `DateField` and `MonthExact`
lookup on the `User.date_joined` (you can use [Field Access API](meta.md#model-meta-field-api) to retrieve a single field instance). It
overrides a lookup that already exists with the same name. Lookups
registered on field instances take precedence over the lookups
registered on classes. `lookup_name` will be used for this lookup if
provided, otherwise `lookup.lookup_name` will be used.

#### get_lookup(lookup_name)

Returns the [`Lookup`](#django.db.models.Lookup) named `lookup_name` registered in the
class or class instance depending on what calls it. The default
implementation looks recursively on all parent classes and checks if
any has a registered lookup named `lookup_name`, returning the first
match. Instance lookups would override any class lookups with the same
`lookup_name`.

#### get_lookups()

Returns a dictionary of each lookup name registered in the class or
class instance mapped to the [`Lookup`](#django.db.models.Lookup) class.

#### get_transform(transform_name)

Returns a [`Transform`](#django.db.models.Transform) named `transform_name` registered in the
class or class instance. The default implementation looks recursively
on all parent classes to check if any has the registered transform
named `transform_name`, returning the first match.

For a class to be a lookup, it must follow the [Query Expression API](#query-expression). [`Lookup`](#django.db.models.Lookup) and [`Transform`](#django.db.models.Transform) naturally
follow this API.

## The Query Expression API

The query expression API is a common set of methods that classes define to be
usable in query expressions to translate themselves into SQL expressions.
Direct field references, aggregates, and `Transform` are examples that follow
this API. A class is said to follow the query expression API when it implements
the following methods:

### as_sql(compiler, connection)

Generates the SQL fragment for the expression. Returns a tuple
`(sql, params)`, where `sql` is the SQL string, and `params` is the
list or tuple of query parameters. The `compiler` is an `SQLCompiler`
object, which has a `compile()` method that can be used to compile other
expressions. The `connection` is the connection used to execute the
query.

Calling `expression.as_sql()` is usually incorrect - instead
`compiler.compile(expression)` should be used. The `compiler.compile()`
method will take care of calling vendor-specific methods of the expression.

Custom keyword arguments may be defined on this method if it’s likely that
`as_vendorname()` methods or subclasses will need to supply data to
override the generation of the SQL string. See [`Func.as_sql()`](expressions.md#django.db.models.Func.as_sql) for
example usage.

### as_vendorname(compiler, connection)

Works like `as_sql()` method. When an expression is compiled by
`compiler.compile()`, Django will first try to call `as_vendorname()`,
where `vendorname` is the vendor name of the backend used for executing
the query. The `vendorname` is one of `postgresql`, `oracle`,
`sqlite`, or `mysql` for Django’s built-in backends.

### get_lookup(lookup_name)

Must return the lookup named `lookup_name`. For instance, by returning
`self.output_field.get_lookup(lookup_name)`.

### get_transform(transform_name)

Must return the lookup named `transform_name`. For instance, by returning
`self.output_field.get_transform(transform_name)`.

### output_field

Defines the type of class returned by the `get_lookup()` method. It must
be a [`Field`](fields.md#django.db.models.Field) instance.

## `Transform` reference

### *class* Transform

A `Transform` is a generic class to implement field transformations. A
prominent example is `__year` that transforms a `DateField` into a
`IntegerField`.

The notation to use a `Transform` in a lookup expression is
`<expression>__<transformation>` (e.g. `date__year`).

This class follows the [Query Expression API](#query-expression),
which implies that you can use
`<expression>__<transform1>__<transform2>`. It’s a specialized
[Func() expression](expressions.md#func-expressions) that only accepts one argument.
It can also be used on the right hand side of a filter or directly as an
annotation.

#### bilateral

A boolean indicating whether this transformation should apply to both
`lhs` and `rhs`. Bilateral transformations will be applied to
`rhs` in the same order as they appear in the lookup expression. By
default it is set to `False`. For example usage, see
[How to write custom lookups](../../howto/custom-lookups.md).

#### lhs

The left-hand side - what is being transformed. It must follow the
[Query Expression API](#query-expression).

#### lookup_name

The name of the lookup, used for identifying it on parsing query
expressions. It cannot contain the string `"__"`.

#### output_field

Defines the class this transformation outputs. It must be a
[`Field`](fields.md#django.db.models.Field) instance. By default is the same as
its `lhs.output_field`.

## `Lookup` reference

### *class* Lookup

A `Lookup` is a generic class to implement lookups. A lookup is a query
expression with a left-hand side, [`lhs`](#django.db.models.Lookup.lhs); a right-hand side,
[`rhs`](#django.db.models.Lookup.rhs); and a `lookup_name` that is used to produce a boolean
comparison between `lhs` and `rhs` such as `lhs in rhs` or
`lhs > rhs`.

The primary notation to use a lookup in an expression is
`<lhs>__<lookup_name>=<rhs>`. Lookups can also be used directly in
`QuerySet` filters:

```default
Book.objects.filter(LessThan(F("word_count"), 7500))
```

…or annotations:

```default
Book.objects.annotate(is_short_story=LessThan(F("word_count"), 7500))
```

#### lhs

The left-hand side - what is being looked up. The object typically
follows the [Query Expression API](#query-expression). It may also
be a plain value.

#### rhs

The right-hand side - what `lhs` is being compared against. It can be
a plain value, or something that compiles into SQL, typically an
`F()` object or a `QuerySet`.

#### lookup_name

The name of this lookup, used to identify it on parsing query
expressions. It cannot contain the string `"__"`.

#### prepare_rhs

Defaults to `True`. When [`rhs`](#django.db.models.Lookup.rhs) is a plain value,
[`prepare_rhs`](#django.db.models.Lookup.prepare_rhs) determines whether it should be prepared for use as
a parameter in a query. In order to do so,
`lhs.output_field.get_prep_value()` is called if defined, or `rhs`
is wrapped in [`Value()`](expressions.md#django.db.models.Value) otherwise.

#### process_lhs(compiler, connection, lhs=None)

Returns a tuple `(lhs_string, lhs_params)`, as returned by
`compiler.compile(lhs)`. This method can be overridden to tune how
the `lhs` is processed.

`compiler` is an `SQLCompiler` object, to be used like
`compiler.compile(lhs)` for compiling `lhs`. The `connection`
can be used for compiling vendor specific SQL. If `lhs` is not
`None`, use it as the processed `lhs` instead of `self.lhs`.

#### process_rhs(compiler, connection)

Behaves the same way as [`process_lhs()`](#django.db.models.Lookup.process_lhs), for the right-hand side.
