# Using the Django authentication system

This document explains the usage of Django’s authentication system in its
default configuration. This configuration has evolved to serve the most common
project needs, handling a reasonably wide range of tasks, and has a careful
implementation of passwords and permissions. For projects where authentication
needs differ from the default, Django supports extensive [extension and
customization](customizing.md) of authentication.

Django authentication provides both authentication and authorization together
and is generally referred to as the authentication system, as these features
are somewhat coupled.

<a id="user-objects"></a>

## `User` objects

[`User`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User) objects are the core of the
authentication system. They typically represent the people interacting with
your site and are used to enable things like restricting access, registering
user profiles, associating content with creators etc. Only one class of user
exists in Django’s authentication framework, i.e., [`'superusers'`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.is_superuser) or admin [`'staff'`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.is_staff) users are just user objects with
special attributes set, not different classes of user objects.

The primary attributes of the default user are:

* [`username`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.username)
* [`password`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.password)
* [`email`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.email)
* [`first_name`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.first_name)
* [`last_name`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.last_name)

See the [`User`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User) API documentation for a
complete reference. The documentation that follows is more task-oriented.

<a id="topics-auth-creating-users"></a>

### Creating users

The most direct way to create users is to use the included
[`create_user()`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.UserManager.create_user) helper function:

```pycon
>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
>>> user = User.objects.create_user("john", "lennon@thebeatles.com", "johnpassword")

# At this point, user is a User object that has already been saved
# to the database. You can continue to change its attributes
# if you want to change other fields.
>>> user.last_name = "Lennon"
>>> user.save()
```

If you have the Django admin installed, you can also [create users
interactively](#auth-admin).

<a id="topics-auth-creating-superusers"></a>

### Creating superusers

Create superusers using the [`createsuperuser`](../../ref/django-admin.md#django-admin-createsuperuser) command:

```console
$ python manage.py createsuperuser --username=joe --email=joe@example.com
```

You will be prompted for a password. After you enter one, the user will be
created immediately. If you leave off the [`--username`](../../ref/django-admin.md#cmdoption-createsuperuser-username) or [`--email`](../../ref/django-admin.md#cmdoption-createsuperuser-email) options, it will
prompt you for those values.

### Changing passwords

Django does not store raw (clear text) passwords on the user model, but only
a hash (see [documentation of how passwords are managed](passwords.md) for full details). Because of this, do not attempt to
manipulate the password attribute of the user directly. This is why a helper
function is used when creating a user.

To change a user’s password, you have several options:

[`manage.py changepassword *username*`](../../ref/django-admin.md#django-admin-changepassword) offers a method
of changing a user’s password from the command line. It prompts you to
change the password of a given user which you must enter twice. If
they both match, the new password will be changed immediately. If you
do not supply a user, the command will attempt to change the password
whose username matches the current system user.

You can also change a password programmatically, using
[`set_password()`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.set_password):

```pycon
>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
>>> u = User.objects.get(username="john")
>>> u.set_password("new password")
>>> u.save()
```

If you have the Django admin installed, you can also change user’s passwords
on the [authentication system’s admin pages](#auth-admin).

Django also provides [views](#built-in-auth-views) and [forms](#built-in-auth-forms) that may be used to allow users to change their own
passwords.

Changing a user’s password will log out all their sessions. See
[Session invalidation on password change](#session-invalidation-on-password-change) for details.

### Authenticating users

### authenticate(request=None, \*\*credentials)

### aauthenticate(request=None, \*\*credentials)

*Asynchronous version*: `aauthenticate()`

Use [`authenticate()`](#django.contrib.auth.authenticate) to verify a set of
credentials. It takes credentials as keyword arguments, `username` and
`password` for the default case, checks them against each
[authentication backend](customizing.md#authentication-backends), and returns a
[`User`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User) object if the credentials are
valid for a backend. If the credentials aren’t valid for any backend or if
a backend raises [`PermissionDenied`](../../ref/exceptions.md#django.core.exceptions.PermissionDenied), it
returns `None`. For example:

```default
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate

user = authenticate(username="john", password="secret")
if user is not None:
    # A backend authenticated the credentials
    ...
else:
    # No backend authenticated the credentials
    ...
```

`request` is an optional [`HttpRequest`](../../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest) which is
passed on the `authenticate()` method of the authentication backends.

#### NOTE
This is a low level way to authenticate a set of credentials; for
example, it’s used by the
[`RemoteUserMiddleware`](../../ref/middleware.md#django.contrib.auth.middleware.RemoteUserMiddleware). Unless
you are writing your own authentication system, you probably won’t use
this. Rather if you’re looking for a way to login a user, use the
[`LoginView`](#django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView).

<a id="topic-authorization"></a>

## Permissions and Authorization

Django comes with a built-in permissions system. It provides a way to assign
permissions to specific users and groups of users.

It’s used by the Django admin site, but you’re welcome to use it in your own
code.

The Django admin site uses permissions as follows:

* Access to view objects is limited to users with the “view” or “change”
  permission for that type of object.
* Access to view the “add” form and add an object is limited to users with
  the “add” permission for that type of object.
* Access to view the change list, view the “change” form and change an
  object is limited to users with the “change” permission for that type of
  object.
* Access to delete an object is limited to users with the “delete”
  permission for that type of object.

Permissions can be set not only per type of object, but also per specific
object instance. By using the
[`has_view_permission()`](../../ref/contrib/admin/index.md#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.has_view_permission),
[`has_add_permission()`](../../ref/contrib/admin/index.md#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.has_add_permission),
[`has_change_permission()`](../../ref/contrib/admin/index.md#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.has_change_permission) and
[`has_delete_permission()`](../../ref/contrib/admin/index.md#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.has_delete_permission) methods provided
by the [`ModelAdmin`](../../ref/contrib/admin/index.md#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin) class, it is possible to
customize permissions for different object instances of the same type.

[`User`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User) objects have two many-to-many
fields: `groups` and `user_permissions`.
[`User`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User) objects can access their related
objects in the same way as any other [Django model](../db/models.md):

```default
myuser.groups.set([group_list])
myuser.groups.add(group, group, ...)
myuser.groups.remove(group, group, ...)
myuser.groups.clear()
myuser.user_permissions.set([permission_list])
myuser.user_permissions.add(permission, permission, ...)
myuser.user_permissions.remove(permission, permission, ...)
myuser.user_permissions.clear()
```

### Default permissions

When `django.contrib.auth` is listed in your [`INSTALLED_APPS`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-INSTALLED_APPS)
setting, it will ensure that four default permissions – add, change, delete,
and view – are created for each Django model defined in one of your installed
applications.

These permissions will be created when you run [`manage.py migrate`](../../ref/django-admin.md#django-admin-migrate); the first time you run `migrate` after adding
`django.contrib.auth` to [`INSTALLED_APPS`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-INSTALLED_APPS), the default permissions
will be created for all previously-installed models, as well as for any new
models being installed at that time. Afterward, it will create default
permissions for new models each time you run [`manage.py migrate`](../../ref/django-admin.md#django-admin-migrate) (the function that creates permissions is connected to the
[`post_migrate`](../../ref/signals.md#django.db.models.signals.post_migrate) signal).

Assuming you have an application with an
[`app_label`](../../ref/models/options.md#django.db.models.Options.app_label) `foo` and a model named `Bar`,
to test for basic permissions you should use:

* add: `user.has_perm('foo.add_bar')`
* change: `user.has_perm('foo.change_bar')`
* delete: `user.has_perm('foo.delete_bar')`
* view: `user.has_perm('foo.view_bar')`

The [`Permission`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.Permission) model is rarely accessed
directly.

### Groups

[`django.contrib.auth.models.Group`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.Group) models are a generic way of
categorizing users so you can apply permissions, or some other label, to those
users. A user can belong to any number of groups.

A user in a group automatically has the permissions granted to that group. For
example, if the group `Site editors` has the permission
`can_edit_home_page`, any user in that group will have that permission.

Beyond permissions, groups are a convenient way to categorize users to give
them some label, or extended functionality. For example, you could create a
group `'Special users'`, and you could write code that could, say, give them
access to a members-only portion of your site, or send them members-only email
messages.

### Programmatically creating permissions

While [custom permissions](customizing.md#custom-permissions) can be defined within
a model’s `Meta` class, you can also create permissions directly. For
example, you can create the `can_publish` permission for a `BlogPost` model
in `myapp`:

```default
from myapp.models import BlogPost
from django.contrib.auth.models import Permission
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType

content_type = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(BlogPost)
permission = Permission.objects.create(
    codename="can_publish",
    name="Can Publish Posts",
    content_type=content_type,
)
```

The permission can then be assigned to a
[`User`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User) via its `user_permissions`
attribute or to a [`Group`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.Group) via its
`permissions` attribute.

### Permission caching

The [`ModelBackend`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend) caches permissions on
the user object after the first time they need to be fetched for a permissions
check. This is typically fine for the request-response cycle since permissions
aren’t typically checked immediately after they are added (in the admin, for
example). If you are adding permissions and checking them immediately
afterward, in a test or view for example, the easiest solution is to re-fetch
the user from the database. For example:

```default
from django.contrib.auth.models import Permission, User
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404

from myapp.models import BlogPost


def user_gains_perms(request, user_id):
    user = get_object_or_404(User, pk=user_id)
    # any permission check will cache the current set of permissions
    user.has_perm("myapp.change_blogpost")

    content_type = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(BlogPost)
    permission = Permission.objects.get(
        codename="change_blogpost",
        content_type=content_type,
    )
    user.user_permissions.add(permission)

    # Checking the cached permission set
    user.has_perm("myapp.change_blogpost")  # False

    # Request new instance of User
    # Be aware that user.refresh_from_db() won't clear the cache.
    user = get_object_or_404(User, pk=user_id)

    # Permission cache is repopulated from the database
    user.has_perm("myapp.change_blogpost")  # True

    ...
```

<a id="proxy-models-permissions-topic"></a>

### Proxy models

Proxy models work exactly the same way as concrete models. Permissions are
created using the own content type of the proxy model. Proxy models don’t
inherit the permissions of the concrete model they subclass:

```default
class Person(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        permissions = [("can_eat_pizzas", "Can eat pizzas")]


class Student(Person):
    class Meta:
        proxy = True
        permissions = [("can_deliver_pizzas", "Can deliver pizzas")]
```

```pycon
>>> # Fetch the content type for the proxy model.
>>> content_type = ContentType.objects.get_for_model(Student, for_concrete_model=False)
>>> student_permissions = Permission.objects.filter(content_type=content_type)
>>> [p.codename for p in student_permissions]
['add_student', 'change_student', 'delete_student', 'view_student',
'can_deliver_pizzas']
>>> for permission in student_permissions:
...     user.user_permissions.add(permission)
...
>>> user.has_perm("app.add_person")
False
>>> user.has_perm("app.can_eat_pizzas")
False
>>> user.has_perms(("app.add_student", "app.can_deliver_pizzas"))
True
```

<a id="auth-web-requests"></a>

## Authentication in web requests

Django uses [sessions](../http/sessions.md) and middleware to hook the
authentication system into [`HttpRequest`](../../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest) objects.

These provide a [`request.user`](../../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest.user)  attribute
and a [`request.auser`](../../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest.auser) async method
on every request which represents the current user. If the current user has not
logged in, this attribute will be set to an instance
of [`AnonymousUser`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser), otherwise it will be an
instance of [`User`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User).

You can tell them apart with
[`is_authenticated`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.is_authenticated), like so:

```default
if request.user.is_authenticated:
    # Do something for authenticated users.
    ...
else:
    # Do something for anonymous users.
    ...
```

Or in an asynchronous view:

```default
user = await request.auser()
if user.is_authenticated:
    # Do something for authenticated users.
    ...
else:
    # Do something for anonymous users.
    ...
```

<a id="how-to-log-a-user-in"></a>

### How to log a user in

If you have an authenticated user you want to attach to the current session
- this is done with a [`login()`](#django.contrib.auth.login) function.

### login(request, user, backend=None)

### alogin(request, user, backend=None)

*Asynchronous version*: `alogin()`

To log a user in, from a view, use [`login()`](#django.contrib.auth.login). It
takes an [`HttpRequest`](../../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest) object and a
[`User`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User) object.
[`login()`](#django.contrib.auth.login) saves the user’s ID in the session,
using Django’s session framework.

Note that any data set during the anonymous session is retained in the
session after a user logs in.

This example shows how you might use both
[`authenticate()`](#django.contrib.auth.authenticate) and
[`login()`](#django.contrib.auth.login):

```default
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login


def my_view(request):
    username = request.POST["username"]
    password = request.POST["password"]
    user = authenticate(request, username=username, password=password)
    if user is not None:
        login(request, user)
        # Redirect to a success page.
        ...
    else:
        # Return an 'invalid login' error message.
        ...
```

#### Selecting the authentication backend

When a user logs in, the user’s ID and the backend that was used for
authentication are saved in the user’s session. This allows the same
[authentication backend](customizing.md#authentication-backends) to fetch the user’s
details on a future request. The authentication backend to save in the session
is selected as follows:

1. Use the value of the optional `backend` argument, if provided.
2. Use the value of the `user.backend` attribute, if present. This allows
   pairing [`authenticate()`](#django.contrib.auth.authenticate) and
   [`login()`](#django.contrib.auth.login):
   [`authenticate()`](#django.contrib.auth.authenticate)
   sets the `user.backend` attribute on the user object it returns.
3. Use the `backend` in [`AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS), if there is only
   one.
4. Otherwise, raise an exception.

In cases 1 and 2, the value of the `backend` argument or the `user.backend`
attribute should be a dotted import path string (like that found in
[`AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS)), not the actual backend class.

### How to log a user out

### logout(request)

### alogout(request)

*Asynchronous version*: `alogout()`

To log out a user who has been logged in via
[`django.contrib.auth.login()`](#django.contrib.auth.login), use
[`django.contrib.auth.logout()`](#django.contrib.auth.logout) within your view. It takes an
[`HttpRequest`](../../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest) object and has no return value.
Example:

```default
from django.contrib.auth import logout


def logout_view(request):
    logout(request)
    # Redirect to a success page.
```

Note that [`logout()`](#django.contrib.auth.logout) doesn’t throw any errors if
the user wasn’t logged in.

When you call [`logout()`](#django.contrib.auth.logout), the session data for
the current request is completely cleaned out. All existing data is
removed. This is to prevent another person from using the same web browser
to log in and have access to the previous user’s session data. If you want
to put anything into the session that will be available to the user
immediately after logging out, do that *after* calling
[`django.contrib.auth.logout()`](#django.contrib.auth.logout).

### Limiting access to logged-in users

#### The raw way

The raw way to limit access to pages is to check
[`request.user.is_authenticated`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.is_authenticated) and either redirect to a
login page:

```default
from django.conf import settings
from django.shortcuts import redirect


def my_view(request):
    if not request.user.is_authenticated:
        return redirect(f"{settings.LOGIN_URL}?next={request.path}")
    # ...
```

…or display an error message:

```default
from django.shortcuts import render


def my_view(request):
    if not request.user.is_authenticated:
        return render(request, "myapp/login_error.html")
    # ...
```

#### The `login_required` decorator

### login_required(redirect_field_name='next', login_url=None)

As a shortcut, you can use the convenient
[`login_required()`](#django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required) decorator:

```default
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required


@login_required
def my_view(request): ...
```

[`login_required()`](#django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required) does the following:

* If the user isn’t logged in, redirect to
  [`settings.LOGIN_URL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-LOGIN_URL), passing the current absolute
  path in the query string. Example: `/accounts/login/?next=/polls/3/`.
* If the user is logged in, execute the view normally. The view code is
  free to assume the user is logged in.

By default, the path that the user should be redirected to upon
successful authentication is stored in a query string parameter called
`"next"`. If you would prefer to use a different name for this parameter,
[`login_required()`](#django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required) takes an
optional `redirect_field_name` parameter:

```default
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required


@login_required(redirect_field_name="my_redirect_field")
def my_view(request): ...
```

Note that if you provide a value to `redirect_field_name`, you will most
likely need to customize your login template as well, since the template
context variable which stores the redirect path will use the value of
`redirect_field_name` as its key rather than `"next"` (the default).

[`login_required()`](#django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required) also takes an
optional `login_url` parameter. Example:

```default
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required


@login_required(login_url="/accounts/login/")
def my_view(request): ...
```

Note that if you don’t specify the `login_url` parameter, you’ll need to
ensure that the [`settings.LOGIN_URL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-LOGIN_URL) and your login
view are properly associated. For example, using the defaults, add the
following lines to your URLconf:

```default
from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views

path("accounts/login/", auth_views.LoginView.as_view()),
```

The [`settings.LOGIN_URL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-LOGIN_URL) also accepts view function
names and [named URL patterns](../http/urls.md#naming-url-patterns). This allows you
to freely remap your login view within your URLconf without having to
update the setting.

#### NOTE
The `login_required` decorator does NOT check the `is_active` flag on a
user, but the default [`AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS) reject inactive
users.

#### SEE ALSO
If you are writing custom views for Django’s admin (or need the same
authorization check that the built-in views use), you may find the
[`django.contrib.admin.views.decorators.staff_member_required()`](../../ref/contrib/admin/index.md#django.contrib.admin.views.decorators.staff_member_required)
decorator a useful alternative to `login_required()`.

#### The `LoginRequiredMixin` mixin

When using [class-based views](../class-based-views/index.md), you can
achieve the same behavior as with `login_required` by using the
`LoginRequiredMixin`. This mixin should be at the leftmost position in the
inheritance list.

### *class* LoginRequiredMixin

If a view is using this mixin, all requests by non-authenticated users will
be redirected to the login page or shown an HTTP 403 Forbidden error,
depending on the
[`raise_exception`](#django.contrib.auth.mixins.AccessMixin.raise_exception) parameter.

You can set any of the parameters of
[`AccessMixin`](#django.contrib.auth.mixins.AccessMixin) to customize the handling
of unauthorized users:

```default
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin


class MyView(LoginRequiredMixin, View):
    login_url = "/login/"
    redirect_field_name = "redirect_to"
```

#### NOTE
Just as the `login_required` decorator, this mixin does NOT check the
`is_active` flag on a user, but the default
[`AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS) reject inactive users.

<a id="disable-login-required-middleware-for-views"></a>

#### The `login_not_required` decorator

When [`LoginRequiredMiddleware`](../../ref/middleware.md#django.contrib.auth.middleware.LoginRequiredMiddleware) is
installed, all views require authentication by default. Some views, such as the
login view, may need to disable this behavior.

### login_not_required()

Allows unauthenticated requests to this view when
[`LoginRequiredMiddleware`](../../ref/middleware.md#django.contrib.auth.middleware.LoginRequiredMiddleware) is
installed.

#### Limiting access to logged-in users that pass a test

To limit access based on certain permissions or some other test, you’d do
essentially the same thing as described in the previous section.

You can run your test on [`request.user`](../../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest.user) in
the view directly. For example, this view checks to make sure the user has an
email in the desired domain and if not, redirects to the login page:

```default
from django.shortcuts import redirect


def my_view(request):
    if not request.user.email.endswith("@example.com"):
        return redirect("/login/?next=%s" % request.path)
    # ...
```

### user_passes_test(test_func, login_url=None, redirect_field_name='next')

As a shortcut, you can use the convenient `user_passes_test` decorator
which performs a redirect when the callable returns `False`:

```default
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import user_passes_test


def email_check(user):
    return user.email.endswith("@example.com")


@user_passes_test(email_check)
def my_view(request): ...
```

[`user_passes_test()`](#django.contrib.auth.decorators.user_passes_test) takes a required
argument: a callable that takes a
[`User`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User) object and returns `True` if
the user is allowed to view the page. Note that
[`user_passes_test()`](#django.contrib.auth.decorators.user_passes_test) does not
automatically check that the [`User`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User) is
not anonymous.

[`user_passes_test()`](#django.contrib.auth.decorators.user_passes_test) takes two
optional arguments:

`login_url`
: Lets you specify the URL that users who don’t pass the test will be
  redirected to. It may be a login page and defaults to
  [`settings.LOGIN_URL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-LOGIN_URL) if you don’t specify one.

`redirect_field_name`
: Same as for [`login_required()`](#django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required).
  Setting it to `None` removes it from the URL, which you may want to do
  if you are redirecting users that don’t pass the test to a non-login
  page where there’s no “next page”.

For example:

```default
@user_passes_test(email_check, login_url="/login/")
def my_view(request): ...
```

### *class* UserPassesTestMixin

When using [class-based views](../class-based-views/index.md), you
can use the `UserPassesTestMixin` to do this.

#### test_func()

You have to override the `test_func()` method of the class to
provide the test that is performed. Furthermore, you can set any of the
parameters of [`AccessMixin`](#django.contrib.auth.mixins.AccessMixin) to
customize the handling of unauthorized users:

```default
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import UserPassesTestMixin


class MyView(UserPassesTestMixin, View):
    def test_func(self):
        return self.request.user.email.endswith("@example.com")
```

#### get_test_func()

You can also override the `get_test_func()` method to have the mixin
use a differently named function for its checks (instead of
[`test_func()`](#django.contrib.auth.mixins.UserPassesTestMixin.test_func)).

#### The `permission_required` decorator

### permission_required(perm, login_url=None, raise_exception=False)

It’s a relatively common task to check whether a user has a particular
permission. For that reason, Django provides a shortcut for that case: the
[`permission_required()`](#django.contrib.auth.decorators.permission_required) decorator:

```default
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required


@permission_required("polls.add_choice")
def my_view(request): ...
```

Just like the [`has_perm()`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.has_perm) method,
permission names take the form `"<app label>.<permission codename>"`
(i.e. `polls.add_choice` for a permission on a model in the `polls`
application).

The decorator may also take an iterable of permissions, in which case the
user must have all of the permissions in order to access the view.

Note that [`permission_required()`](#django.contrib.auth.decorators.permission_required)
also takes an optional `login_url` parameter:

```default
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required


@permission_required("polls.add_choice", login_url="/loginpage/")
def my_view(request): ...
```

As in the [`login_required()`](#django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required) decorator,
`login_url` defaults to [`settings.LOGIN_URL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-LOGIN_URL).

If the `raise_exception` parameter is given, the decorator will raise
[`PermissionDenied`](../../ref/exceptions.md#django.core.exceptions.PermissionDenied), prompting [the 403
(HTTP Forbidden) view](../../ref/views.md#http-forbidden-view) instead of redirecting to the
login page.

If you want to use `raise_exception` but also give your users a chance to
login first, you can add the
[`login_required()`](#django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required) decorator:

```default
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required, permission_required


@login_required
@permission_required("polls.add_choice", raise_exception=True)
def my_view(request): ...
```

This also avoids a redirect loop when [`LoginView`](#django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView)’s
`redirect_authenticated_user=True` and the logged-in user doesn’t have
all of the required permissions.

#### The `PermissionRequiredMixin` mixin

To apply permission checks to [class-based views](../../ref/class-based-views/index.md), you can use the `PermissionRequiredMixin`:

### *class* PermissionRequiredMixin

This mixin, just like the `permission_required`
decorator, checks whether the user accessing a view has all given
permissions. You should specify the permission (or an iterable of
permissions) using the `permission_required` parameter:

```default
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import PermissionRequiredMixin


class MyView(PermissionRequiredMixin, View):
    permission_required = "polls.add_choice"
    # Or multiple of permissions:
    permission_required = ["polls.view_choice", "polls.change_choice"]
```

You can set any of the parameters of
[`AccessMixin`](#django.contrib.auth.mixins.AccessMixin) to customize the handling
of unauthorized users.

You may also override these methods:

#### get_permission_required()

Returns an iterable of permission names used by the mixin. Defaults to
the `permission_required` attribute, converted to a tuple if
necessary.

#### has_permission()

Returns a boolean denoting whether the current user has permission to
execute the decorated view. By default, this returns the result of
calling [`has_perms()`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.has_perms) with the
list of permissions returned by [`get_permission_required()`](#django.contrib.auth.mixins.PermissionRequiredMixin.get_permission_required).

### Redirecting unauthorized requests in class-based views

To ease the handling of access restrictions in [class-based views](../../ref/class-based-views/index.md), the `AccessMixin` can be used to configure
the behavior of a view when access is denied. Authenticated users are denied
access with an HTTP 403 Forbidden response. Anonymous users are redirected to
the login page or shown an HTTP 403 Forbidden response, depending on the
[`raise_exception`](#django.contrib.auth.mixins.AccessMixin.raise_exception) attribute.

### *class* AccessMixin

#### login_url

Default return value for [`get_login_url()`](#django.contrib.auth.mixins.AccessMixin.get_login_url). Defaults to `None`
in which case [`get_login_url()`](#django.contrib.auth.mixins.AccessMixin.get_login_url) falls back to
[`settings.LOGIN_URL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-LOGIN_URL).

#### permission_denied_message

Default return value for [`get_permission_denied_message()`](#django.contrib.auth.mixins.AccessMixin.get_permission_denied_message).
Defaults to an empty string.

#### redirect_field_name

Default return value for [`get_redirect_field_name()`](#django.contrib.auth.mixins.AccessMixin.get_redirect_field_name). Defaults to
`"next"`.

#### raise_exception

If this attribute is set to `True`, a
[`PermissionDenied`](../../ref/exceptions.md#django.core.exceptions.PermissionDenied) exception is raised
when the conditions are not met. When `False` (the default),
anonymous users are redirected to the login page.

#### get_login_url()

Returns the URL that users who don’t pass the test will be redirected
to. Returns [`login_url`](#django.contrib.auth.mixins.AccessMixin.login_url) if set, or [`settings.LOGIN_URL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-LOGIN_URL) otherwise.

#### get_permission_denied_message()

When [`raise_exception`](#django.contrib.auth.mixins.AccessMixin.raise_exception) is `True`, this method can be used to
control the error message passed to the error handler for display to
the user. Returns the [`permission_denied_message`](#django.contrib.auth.mixins.AccessMixin.permission_denied_message) attribute by
default.

#### get_redirect_field_name()

Returns the name of the query parameter that will contain the URL the
user should be redirected to after a successful login. If you set this
to `None`, a query parameter won’t be added. Returns the
[`redirect_field_name`](#django.contrib.auth.mixins.AccessMixin.redirect_field_name) attribute by default.

#### handle_no_permission()

Depending on the value of `raise_exception`, the method either raises
a [`PermissionDenied`](../../ref/exceptions.md#django.core.exceptions.PermissionDenied) exception or
redirects the user to the `login_url`, optionally including the
`redirect_field_name` if it is set.

<a id="session-invalidation-on-password-change"></a>

#### Session invalidation on password change

If your [`AUTH_USER_MODEL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-AUTH_USER_MODEL) inherits from
[`AbstractBaseUser`](customizing.md#django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractBaseUser) or implements its own
[`get_session_auth_hash()`](customizing.md#django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractBaseUser.get_session_auth_hash)
method, authenticated sessions will include the hash returned by this function.
In the [`AbstractBaseUser`](customizing.md#django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractBaseUser) case, this is an
HMAC of the password field. Django verifies that the hash in the session for
each request matches the one that’s computed during the request. This allows a
user to log out all of their sessions by changing their password.

The default password change views included with Django,
[`PasswordChangeView`](#django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordChangeView) and the
`user_change_password` view in the [`django.contrib.auth`](index.md#module-django.contrib.auth) admin, update
the session with the new password hash so that a user changing their own
password won’t log themselves out. If you have a custom password change view
and wish to have similar behavior, use the [`update_session_auth_hash()`](#django.contrib.auth.update_session_auth_hash)
function.

### update_session_auth_hash(request, user)

### aupdate_session_auth_hash(request, user)

*Asynchronous version*: `aupdate_session_auth_hash()`

This function takes the current request and the updated user object from
which the new session hash will be derived and updates the session hash
appropriately. It also rotates the session key so that a stolen session
cookie will be invalidated.

Example usage:

```default
from django.contrib.auth import update_session_auth_hash


def password_change(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        form = PasswordChangeForm(user=request.user, data=request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            update_session_auth_hash(request, form.user)
    else:
        ...
```

#### NOTE
Since
[`get_session_auth_hash()`](customizing.md#django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractBaseUser.get_session_auth_hash)
is based on [`SECRET_KEY`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-SECRET_KEY), secret key values must be
rotated to avoid invalidating existing sessions when updating your site to
use a new secret. See [`SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS) for details.

### Authentication Views

Django provides several views that you can use for handling login, logout, and
password management. These make use of the [stock auth forms](#built-in-auth-forms) but you can pass in your own forms as well.

Django provides no default template for the authentication views. You should
create your own templates for the views you want to use. The template context
is documented in each view, see [All authentication views](#all-authentication-views).

<a id="using-the-views"></a>

#### Using the views

There are different methods to implement these views in your project. The
easiest way is to include the provided URLconf in `django.contrib.auth.urls`
in your own URLconf, for example:

```default
urlpatterns = [
    path("accounts/", include("django.contrib.auth.urls")),
]
```

This will include the following URL patterns:

```text
accounts/login/ [name='login']
accounts/logout/ [name='logout']
accounts/password_change/ [name='password_change']
accounts/password_change/done/ [name='password_change_done']
accounts/password_reset/ [name='password_reset']
accounts/password_reset/done/ [name='password_reset_done']
accounts/reset/<uidb64>/<token>/ [name='password_reset_confirm']
accounts/reset/done/ [name='password_reset_complete']
```

The views provide a URL name for easier reference. See [the URL
documentation](../http/urls.md) for details on using named URL patterns.

If you want more control over your URLs, you can reference a specific view in
your URLconf:

```default
from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views

urlpatterns = [
    path("change-password/", auth_views.PasswordChangeView.as_view()),
]
```

The views have optional arguments you can use to alter the behavior of the
view. For example, if you want to change the template name a view uses, you can
provide the `template_name` argument. A way to do this is to provide keyword
arguments in the URLconf, these will be passed on to the view. For example:

```default
urlpatterns = [
    path(
        "change-password/",
        auth_views.PasswordChangeView.as_view(template_name="change-password.html"),
    ),
]
```

All views are [class-based](../class-based-views/index.md), which
allows you to easily customize them by subclassing.

<a id="all-authentication-views"></a>

#### All authentication views

This is a list with all the views `django.contrib.auth` provides. For
implementation details see [Using the views](#using-the-views).

### *class* LoginView

**URL name:** `login`

See [the URL documentation](../http/urls.md) for details on using
named URL patterns.

**Methods and Attributes**

#### template_name

The name of a template to display for the view used to log the user in.
Defaults to `registration/login.html`.

#### next_page

The URL to redirect to after login. Defaults to
[`LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL).

#### redirect_field_name

The name of a `GET` field containing the URL to redirect to after
login. Defaults to `next`. Overrides the
[`get_default_redirect_url()`](#django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView.get_default_redirect_url) URL if the given `GET` parameter is
passed.

#### authentication_form

A callable (typically a form class) to use for authentication. Defaults
to [`AuthenticationForm`](#django.contrib.auth.forms.AuthenticationForm).

#### extra_context

A dictionary of context data that will be added to the default context
data passed to the template.

#### redirect_authenticated_user

A boolean that controls whether or not authenticated users accessing
the login page will be redirected as if they had just successfully
logged in. Defaults to `False`.

#### WARNING
If you enable `redirect_authenticated_user`, other websites will
be able to determine if their visitors are authenticated on your
site by requesting redirect URLs to image files on your website. To
avoid this “[social media fingerprinting](https://robinlinus.github.io/socialmedia-leak/)” information
leakage, host all images and your favicon on a separate domain.

Enabling `redirect_authenticated_user` can also result in a
redirect loop when using the [`permission_required()`](#django.contrib.auth.decorators.permission_required) decorator
unless the `raise_exception` parameter is used.

#### success_url_allowed_hosts

A [`set`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set) of hosts, in addition to [`request.get_host()`](../../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest.get_host), that are safe for redirecting
after login. Defaults to an empty [`set`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set).

#### get_default_redirect_url()

Returns the URL to redirect to after login. The default implementation
resolves and returns [`next_page`](#django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView.next_page) if set, or
[`LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL) otherwise.

Here’s what `LoginView` does:

* If called via `GET`, it displays a login form that POSTs to the
  same URL. More on this in a bit.
* If called via `POST` with user submitted credentials, it tries to log
  the user in. If login is successful, the view redirects to the URL
  specified in `next`. If `next` isn’t provided, it redirects to
  [`settings.LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL) (which
  defaults to `/accounts/profile/`). If login isn’t successful, it
  redisplays the login form.

It’s your responsibility to provide the html for the login template
, called `registration/login.html` by default. This template gets passed
four template context variables:

* `form`: A [`Form`](../../ref/forms/api.md#django.forms.Form) object representing the
  [`AuthenticationForm`](#django.contrib.auth.forms.AuthenticationForm).
* `next`: The URL to redirect to after successful login. This may
  contain a query string, too.
* `site`: The current [`Site`](../../ref/contrib/sites.md#django.contrib.sites.models.Site),
  according to the [`SITE_ID`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-SITE_ID) setting. If you don’t have the
  site framework installed, this will be set to an instance of
  [`RequestSite`](../../ref/contrib/sites.md#django.contrib.sites.requests.RequestSite), which derives the
  site name and domain from the current
  [`HttpRequest`](../../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest).
* `site_name`: An alias for `site.name`. If you don’t have the site
  framework installed, this will be set to the value of
  [`request.META['SERVER_NAME']`](../../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest.META).
  For more on sites, see [The “sites” framework](../../ref/contrib/sites.md).

If you’d prefer not to call the template `registration/login.html`,
you can pass the `template_name` parameter via the extra arguments to the
`as_view` method in your URLconf. For example, this URLconf line would
use `myapp/login.html` instead:

```default
path("accounts/login/", auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name="myapp/login.html")),
```

You can also specify the name of the `GET` field which contains the URL
to redirect to after login using `redirect_field_name`. By default, the
field is called `next`.

Here’s a sample `registration/login.html` template you can use as a
starting point. It assumes you have a `base.html` template that
defines a `content` block:

```html+django
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}

{% if form.errors %}
<p>Your username and password didn't match. Please try again.</p>
{% endif %}

{% if next %}
    {% if user.is_authenticated %}
    <p>Your account doesn't have access to this page. To proceed,
    please login with an account that has access.</p>
    {% else %}
    <p>Please login to see this page.</p>
    {% endif %}
{% endif %}

<form method="post" action="{% url 'login' %}">
{% csrf_token %}
<table>
<tr>
    <td>{{ form.username.label_tag }}</td>
    <td>{{ form.username }}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>{{ form.password.label_tag }}</td>
    <td>{{ form.password }}</td>
</tr>
</table>

<input type="submit" value="login">
<input type="hidden" name="next" value="{{ next }}">
</form>

{# Assumes you set up the password_reset view in your URLconf #}
<p><a href="{% url 'password_reset' %}">Lost password?</a></p>

{% endblock %}
```

If you have customized authentication (see [Customizing Authentication](customizing.md)) you can use a custom authentication form by
setting the `authentication_form` attribute. This form must accept a
`request` keyword argument in its `__init__()` method and provide a
`get_user()` method which returns the authenticated user object (this
method is only ever called after successful form validation).

### *class* LogoutView

Logs a user out on `POST` requests.

**URL name:** `logout`

**Attributes:**

#### next_page

The URL to redirect to after logout. Defaults to
[`LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL).

#### template_name

The full name of a template to display after logging the user out.
Defaults to `registration/logged_out.html`.

#### redirect_field_name

The name of a `GET` field containing the URL to redirect to after log
out. Defaults to `'next'`. Overrides the
[`next_page`](#django.contrib.auth.views.LogoutView.next_page) URL if the given `GET` parameter is
passed.

#### extra_context

A dictionary of context data that will be added to the default context
data passed to the template.

#### success_url_allowed_hosts

A [`set`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set) of hosts, in addition to [`request.get_host()`](../../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest.get_host), that are safe for redirecting
after logout. Defaults to an empty [`set`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set).

**Template context:**

* `title`: The string “Logged out”, localized.
* `site`: The current [`Site`](../../ref/contrib/sites.md#django.contrib.sites.models.Site),
  according to the [`SITE_ID`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-SITE_ID) setting. If you don’t have the
  site framework installed, this will be set to an instance of
  [`RequestSite`](../../ref/contrib/sites.md#django.contrib.sites.requests.RequestSite), which derives the
  site name and domain from the current
  [`HttpRequest`](../../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest).
* `site_name`: An alias for `site.name`. If you don’t have the site
  framework installed, this will be set to the value of
  [`request.META['SERVER_NAME']`](../../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest.META).
  For more on sites, see [The “sites” framework](../../ref/contrib/sites.md).

### logout_then_login(request, login_url=None)

Logs a user out on `POST` requests, then redirects to the login page.

**URL name:** No default URL provided

**Optional arguments:**

* `login_url`: The URL of the login page to redirect to.
  Defaults to [`settings.LOGIN_URL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-LOGIN_URL) if not supplied.

### *class* PasswordChangeView

**URL name:** `password_change`

Allows a user to change their password.

**Attributes:**

#### template_name

The full name of a template to use for displaying the password change
form. Defaults to `registration/password_change_form.html` if not
supplied.

#### success_url

The URL to redirect to after a successful password change. Defaults to
`'password_change_done'`.

#### form_class

A custom “change password” form which must accept a `user` keyword
argument. The form is responsible for actually changing the user’s
password. Defaults to
[`PasswordChangeForm`](#django.contrib.auth.forms.PasswordChangeForm).

#### extra_context

A dictionary of context data that will be added to the default context
data passed to the template.

**Template context:**

* `form`: The password change form (see `form_class` above).

### *class* PasswordChangeDoneView

**URL name:** `password_change_done`

The page shown after a user has changed their password.

**Attributes:**

#### template_name

The full name of a template to use. Defaults to
`registration/password_change_done.html` if not supplied.

#### extra_context

A dictionary of context data that will be added to the default context
data passed to the template.

### *class* PasswordResetView

**URL name:** `password_reset`

Allows a user to reset their password by generating a one-time use link
that can be used to reset the password, and sending that link to the
user’s registered email address.

This view will send an email if the following conditions are met:

* The email address provided exists in the system.
* The requested user is active (`User.is_active` is `True`).
* The requested user has a usable password. Users flagged with an unusable
  password (see
  [`set_unusable_password()`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.set_unusable_password)) aren’t
  allowed to request a password reset to prevent misuse when using an
  external authentication source like LDAP.

If any of these conditions are *not* met, no email will be sent, but the
user won’t receive any error message either. This prevents information
leaking to potential attackers. If you want to provide an error message in
this case, you can subclass
[`PasswordResetForm`](#django.contrib.auth.forms.PasswordResetForm) and use the
`form_class` attribute.

#### NOTE
Be aware that sending an email costs extra time, hence you may be
vulnerable to an email address enumeration timing attack due to a
difference between the duration of a reset request for an existing
email address and the duration of a reset request for a nonexistent
email address. To reduce the overhead, you can use a 3rd party package
that allows to send emails asynchronously, e.g. [django-mailer](https://pypi.org/project/django-mailer/).

**Attributes:**

#### template_name

The full name of a template to use for displaying the password reset
form. Defaults to `registration/password_reset_form.html` if not
supplied.

#### form_class

Form that will be used to get the email of the user to reset the
password for. Defaults to
[`PasswordResetForm`](#django.contrib.auth.forms.PasswordResetForm).

#### email_template_name

The full name of a template to use for generating the email with the
reset password link. Defaults to
`registration/password_reset_email.html` if not supplied.

#### subject_template_name

The full name of a template to use for the subject of the email with
the reset password link. Defaults to
`registration/password_reset_subject.txt` if not supplied.

#### token_generator

Instance of the class to check the one time link. This will default to
`default_token_generator`, it’s an instance of
`django.contrib.auth.tokens.PasswordResetTokenGenerator`.

#### success_url

The URL to redirect to after a successful password reset request.
Defaults to `'password_reset_done'`.

#### from_email

A valid email address. By default Django uses the
[`DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL).

#### extra_context

A dictionary of context data that will be added to the default context
data passed to the template.

#### html_email_template_name

The full name of a template to use for generating a
*text/html* multipart email with the password reset link. By
default, HTML email is not sent.

#### extra_email_context

A dictionary of context data that will be available in the email
template. It can be used to override default template context values
listed below e.g. `domain`.

**Template context:**

* `form`: The form (see `form_class` above) for resetting the user’s
  password.

**Email template context:**

* `email`: An alias for `user.email`
* `user`: The current [`User`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User),
  according to the `email` form field. Only active users are able to
  reset their passwords (`User.is_active is True`).
* `site_name`: An alias for `site.name`. If you don’t have the site
  framework installed, this will be set to the value of
  [`request.META['SERVER_NAME']`](../../ref/request-response.md#django.http.HttpRequest.META).
  For more on sites, see [The “sites” framework](../../ref/contrib/sites.md).
* `domain`: An alias for `site.domain`. If you don’t have the site
  framework installed, this will be set to the value of
  `request.get_host()`.
* `protocol`: http or https
* `uid`: The user’s primary key encoded in base 64.
* `token`: Token to check that the reset link is valid.

Sample `registration/password_reset_email.html` (email body template):

```html+django
Someone asked for password reset for email {{ email }}. Follow the link below:
{{ protocol}}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}
```

The same template context is used for subject template. Subject must be
single line plain text string.

### *class* PasswordResetDoneView

**URL name:** `password_reset_done`

The page shown after a user has been emailed a link to reset their
password. This view is called by default if the [`PasswordResetView`](#django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordResetView)
doesn’t have an explicit `success_url` URL set.

#### NOTE
If the email address provided does not exist in the system, the user is
inactive, or has an unusable password, the user will still be
redirected to this view but no email will be sent.

multiple [`AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS) configured. Defaults to
`None`.

#### form_class

Form that will be used to set the password. Defaults to
[`SetPasswordForm`](#django.contrib.auth.forms.SetPasswordForm).

successful login.

**Required arguments:**

* `next`: The URL to redirect to after a successful login.

**Optional arguments:**

* `login_url`: The URL of the login page to redirect to.
  Defaults to [`settings.LOGIN_URL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-LOGIN_URL) if not supplied.
* `redirect_field_name`: The name of a `GET` field containing the
  URL to redirect to after login. Overrides `next` if the given
  `GET` parameter is passed.

### Built-in forms

If you don’t want to use the built-in views, but want the convenience of not
having to write forms for this functionality, the authentication system
provides several built-in forms located in [`django.contrib.auth.forms`](#module-django.contrib.auth.forms):

#### NOTE
The built-in authentication forms make certain assumptions about the user
model that they are working with. If you’re using a [custom user model](customizing.md#auth-custom-user), it may be necessary to define your own forms for the
authentication system. For more information, refer to the documentation
about [using the built-in authentication forms with custom user models](customizing.md#custom-users-and-the-built-in-auth-forms).

### *class* AdminPasswordChangeForm

A form used in the admin interface to change a user’s password, including
the ability to set an unusable password (via
[`set_unusable_password()`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.set_unusable_password)), which
blocks the user from logging in with password-based authentication.

Takes the `user` as the first positional argument.

### *class* AdminUserCreationForm

A form used in the admin interface to create a new user. Inherits from
[`UserCreationForm`](#django.contrib.auth.forms.UserCreationForm).

It includes an additional `usable_password` field, enabled by default. If
`usable_password` is enabled, it verifies that `password1` and
`password2` are non empty and match, validates the password using
[`validate_password()`](passwords.md#django.contrib.auth.password_validation.validate_password), and
sets the user’s password using
[`set_password()`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.set_password).
If `usable_password` is disabled, no password validation is done, and
password-based authentication is disabled for the user by calling
[`set_unusable_password()`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.set_unusable_password).

### *class* AuthenticationForm

A form for logging a user in.

Takes `request` as its first positional argument, which is stored on the
form instance for use by sub-classes.

#### confirm_login_allowed(user)

By default, `AuthenticationForm` rejects users whose `is_active`
flag is set to `False`. You may override this behavior with a custom
policy to determine which users can log in. Do this with a custom form
that subclasses `AuthenticationForm` and overrides the
`confirm_login_allowed()` method. This method should raise a
[`ValidationError`](../../ref/exceptions.md#django.core.exceptions.ValidationError) if the given user may
not log in.

For example, to allow all users to log in regardless of “active”
status:

```default
from django.contrib.auth.forms import AuthenticationForm


class AuthenticationFormWithInactiveUsersOkay(AuthenticationForm):
    def confirm_login_allowed(self, user):
        pass
```

(In this case, you’ll also need to use an authentication backend that
allows inactive users, such as
[`AllowAllUsersModelBackend`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.backends.AllowAllUsersModelBackend).)

Or to allow only some active users to log in:

```default
class PickyAuthenticationForm(AuthenticationForm):
    def confirm_login_allowed(self, user):
        if not user.is_active:
            raise ValidationError(
                _("This account is inactive."),
                code="inactive",
            )
        if user.username.startswith("b"):
            raise ValidationError(
                _("Sorry, accounts starting with 'b' aren't welcome here."),
                code="no_b_users",
            )
```

### *class* BaseUserCreationForm

A [`ModelForm`](../forms/modelforms.md#django.forms.ModelForm) for creating a new user. This is the
recommended base class if you need to customize the user creation form.

It has three fields: `username` (from the user model), `password1`,
and `password2`. It verifies that `password1` and `password2` match,
validates the password using
[`validate_password()`](passwords.md#django.contrib.auth.password_validation.validate_password), and
sets the user’s password using
[`set_password()`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.set_password).

### *class* PasswordChangeForm

A form for allowing a user to change their password.

### *class* PasswordResetForm

A form for generating and emailing a one-time use link to reset a
user’s password.

#### send_mail(subject_template_name, email_template_name, context, from_email, to_email, html_email_template_name=None)

Uses the arguments to send an `EmailMultiAlternatives`.
Can be overridden to customize how the email is sent to the user. If
you choose to override this method, be mindful of handling potential
exceptions raised due to email sending failures.

* **Parameters:**
  * **subject_template_name** – the template for the subject.
  * **email_template_name** – the template for the email body.
  * **context** – context passed to the `subject_template`,
    `email_template`, and `html_email_template` (if it is not
    `None`).
  * **from_email** – the sender’s email.
  * **to_email** – the email of the requester.
  * **html_email_template_name** – the template for the HTML body;
    defaults to `None`, in which case a plain text email is sent.

By default, `save()` populates the `context` with the
same variables that
[`PasswordResetView`](#django.contrib.auth.views.PasswordResetView) passes to its
email context.

### *class* SetPasswordForm

A form that lets a user change their password without entering the old
password.

### *class* UserChangeForm

A form used in the admin interface to change a user’s information and
permissions.

### *class* UserCreationForm

Inherits from [`BaseUserCreationForm`](#django.contrib.auth.forms.BaseUserCreationForm). To help prevent confusion with
similar usernames, the form doesn’t allow usernames that differ only in
case.

### Authentication data in templates

The currently logged-in user and their permissions are made available in the
[template context](../../ref/templates/api.md) when you use
[`RequestContext`](../../ref/templates/api.md#django.template.RequestContext).

#### Users

When rendering a template [`RequestContext`](../../ref/templates/api.md#django.template.RequestContext), the
currently logged-in user, either a  [`User`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User)
instance or an [`AnonymousUser`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser) instance, is
stored in the template variable `{{ user }}`:

```html+django
{% if user.is_authenticated %}
    <p>Welcome, {{ user.username }}. Thanks for logging in.</p>
{% else %}
    <p>Welcome, new user. Please log in.</p>
{% endif %}
```

This template context variable is not available if a `RequestContext` is not
being used.

#### Permissions

The currently logged-in user’s permissions are stored in the template variable
`{{ perms }}`. This is an instance of
`django.contrib.auth.context_processors.PermWrapper`, which is a
template-friendly proxy of permissions.

Evaluating a single-attribute lookup of `{{ perms }}` as a boolean is a proxy
to [`User.has_module_perms()`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.has_module_perms). For example, to check if
the logged-in user has any permissions in the `foo` app:

```html+django
{% if perms.foo %}
```

Evaluating a two-level-attribute lookup as a boolean is a proxy to
[`User.has_perm()`](../../ref/contrib/auth.md#django.contrib.auth.models.User.has_perm). For
example, to check if the logged-in user has the permission `foo.add_vote`:

```html+django
{% if perms.foo.add_vote %}
```

Here’s a more complete example of checking permissions in a template:

```html+django
{% if perms.foo %}
    <p>You have permission to do something in the foo app.</p>
    {% if perms.foo.add_vote %}
        <p>You can vote!</p>
    {% endif %}
    {% if perms.foo.add_driving %}
        <p>You can drive!</p>
    {% endif %}
{% else %}
    <p>You don't have permission to do anything in the foo app.</p>
{% endif %}
```

It is possible to also look permissions up by `{% if in %}` statements.
For example:

```html+django
{% if 'foo' in perms %}
    {% if 'foo.add_vote' in perms %}
        <p>In lookup works, too.</p>
    {% endif %}
{% endif %}
```

## Managing users in the admin

When you have both `django.contrib.admin` and `django.contrib.auth`
installed, the admin provides a convenient way to view and manage users,
groups, and permissions. Users can be created and deleted like any Django
model. Groups can be created, and permissions can be assigned to users or
groups. A log of user edits to models made within the admin is also stored and
displayed.

### Creating users

You should see a link to “Users” in the “Auth”
section of the main admin index page. The “Add user” admin page is different
than standard admin pages in that it requires you to choose a username and
password before allowing you to edit the rest of the user’s fields.
Alternatively, on this page, you can choose a username and disable
password-based authentication for the user.

Also note: if you want a user account to be able to create users using the
Django admin site, you’ll need to give them permission to add users *and*
change users (i.e., the “Add user” and “Change user” permissions). If an
account has permission to add users but not to change them, that account won’t
be able to add users. Why? Because if you have permission to add users, you
have the power to create superusers, which can then, in turn, change other
users. So Django requires add *and* change permissions as a slight security
measure.

Be thoughtful about how you allow users to manage permissions. If you give a
non-superuser the ability to edit users, this is ultimately the same as giving
them superuser status because they will be able to elevate permissions of
users including themselves!

### Changing passwords

User passwords are not displayed in the admin (nor stored in the database), but
the [password storage details](passwords.md) are displayed.
Included in the display of this information is a link to
a password change form that allows admins to change or unset user passwords.
