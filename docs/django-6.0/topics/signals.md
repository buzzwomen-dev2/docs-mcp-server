# Signals

Django includes a “signal dispatcher” which helps decoupled applications get
notified when actions occur elsewhere in the framework. In a nutshell, signals
allow certain *senders* to notify a set of *receivers* that some action has
taken place. They’re especially useful when many pieces of code may be
interested in the same events.

For example, a third-party app can register to be notified of settings
changes:

```default
from django.apps import AppConfig
from django.core.signals import setting_changed


def my_callback(sender, **kwargs):
    print("Setting changed!")


class MyAppConfig(AppConfig):
    ...

    def ready(self):
        setting_changed.connect(my_callback)
```

Django’s [built-in signals](../ref/signals.md) let user code get notified of
certain actions.

You can also define and send your own custom signals. See
[Defining and sending signals](#defining-and-sending-signals) below.

#### WARNING
Signals give the appearance of loose coupling, but they can quickly lead to
code that is hard to understand, adjust and debug.

Where possible you should opt for directly calling the handling code,
rather than dispatching via a signal.

## Listening to signals

To receive a signal, register a *receiver* function using the
[`Signal.connect()`](#django.dispatch.Signal.connect) method. The receiver function is called when the signal
is sent. All of the signal’s receiver functions are called one at a time, in
the order they were registered.

#### Signal.connect(receiver, sender=None, weak=True, dispatch_uid=None)

* **Parameters:**
  * **receiver** – The callback function which will be connected to this
    signal. See [Receiver functions](#receiver-functions) for more information.
  * **sender** – Specifies a particular sender to receive signals from. See
    [Connecting to signals sent by specific senders](#connecting-to-specific-signals) for more information.
  * **weak** – Django stores signal handlers as weak references by
    default. Thus, if your receiver is a local function, it may be
    garbage collected. To prevent this, pass `weak=False` when you call
    the signal’s `connect()` method.
  * **dispatch_uid** – A unique identifier for a signal receiver in cases
    where duplicate signals may be sent. See
    [Preventing duplicate signals](#preventing-duplicate-signals) for more information.

Let’s see how this works by registering a signal that
gets called after each HTTP request is finished. We’ll be connecting to the
[`request_finished`](../ref/signals.md#django.core.signals.request_finished) signal.

### Receiver functions

First, we need to define a receiver function. A receiver can be any Python
function or method:

```default
def my_callback(sender, **kwargs):
    print("Request finished!")
```

Notice that the function takes a `sender` argument, along with wildcard
keyword arguments (`**kwargs`); all signal handlers must take these
arguments.

We’ll look at senders [a bit later](#connecting-to-specific-signals), but
right now look at the `**kwargs` argument. All signals send keyword
arguments, and may change those keyword arguments at any time. In the case of
[`request_finished`](../ref/signals.md#django.core.signals.request_finished), it’s documented as sending no
arguments, which means we might be tempted to write our signal handling as
`my_callback(sender)`.

This would be wrong – in fact, Django will throw an error if you do so. That’s
because at any point arguments could get added to the signal and your receiver
must be able to handle those new arguments.

Receivers may also be asynchronous functions, with the same signature but
declared using `async def`:

```default
async def my_callback(sender, **kwargs):
    await asyncio.sleep(5)
    print("Request finished!")
```

Signals can be sent either synchronously or asynchronously, and receivers will
automatically be adapted to the correct call-style. See [sending signals](#sending-signals) for more information.

<a id="connecting-receiver-functions"></a>

### Connecting receiver functions

There are two ways you can connect a receiver to a signal. You can take the
manual connect route:

```default
from django.core.signals import request_finished

request_finished.connect(my_callback)
```

Alternatively, you can use a [`receiver()`](#django.dispatch.receiver) decorator:

### receiver(signal, \*\*kwargs)

* **Parameters:**
  * **signal** – A signal or a list of signals to connect a function to.
  * **kwargs** – Wildcard keyword arguments to pass to a
    [function](#receiver-functions).

Here’s how you connect with the decorator:

```default
from django.core.signals import request_finished
from django.dispatch import receiver


@receiver(request_finished)
def my_callback(sender, **kwargs):
    print("Request finished!")
```

Now, our `my_callback` function will be called each time a request finishes.

#### NOTE
The [`ready()`](../ref/applications.md#django.apps.AppConfig.ready) method may be executed more than
once during testing, so you may want to [guard your signals from
duplication](#preventing-duplicate-signals), especially if you’re planning
to send them within tests.

<a id="connecting-to-specific-signals"></a>

### Connecting to signals sent by specific senders

Some signals get sent many times, but you’ll only be interested in receiving a
certain subset of those signals. For example, consider the
[`django.db.models.signals.pre_save`](../ref/signals.md#django.db.models.signals.pre_save) signal sent before a model gets
saved. Most of the time, you don’t need to know when *any* model gets saved –
just when one *specific* model is saved.

In these cases, you can register to receive signals sent only by particular
senders. In the case of [`django.db.models.signals.pre_save`](../ref/signals.md#django.db.models.signals.pre_save), the sender
will be the model class being saved, so you can indicate that you only want
signals sent by some model:

```default
from django.db.models.signals import pre_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from myapp.models import MyModel


@receiver(pre_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_handler(sender, **kwargs): ...
```

The `my_handler` function will only be called when an instance of `MyModel`
is saved.

Different signals use different objects as their senders; you’ll need to
consult the [built-in signal documentation](../ref/signals.md) for details of
each particular signal.

### Preventing duplicate signals

In some circumstances, the code connecting receivers to signals may run
multiple times. This can cause your receiver function to be registered more
than once, and thus called as many times for a signal event. For example, the
[`ready()`](../ref/applications.md#django.apps.AppConfig.ready) method may be executed more than once
during testing. More generally, this occurs everywhere your project imports the
module where you define the signals, because signal registration runs as many
times as it is imported.

If this behavior is problematic (such as when using signals to
send an email whenever a model is saved), pass a unique identifier as
the `dispatch_uid` argument to identify your receiver function. This
identifier will usually be a string, although any hashable object will
suffice. The end result is that your receiver function will only be
bound to the signal once for each unique `dispatch_uid` value:

```default
from django.core.signals import request_finished

request_finished.connect(my_callback, dispatch_uid="my_unique_identifier")
```

## Defining and sending signals

Your applications can take advantage of the signal infrastructure and provide
its own signals.

### Defining signals

### *class* Signal

All signals are [`django.dispatch.Signal`](#django.dispatch.Signal) instances.

For example:

```default
import django.dispatch

pizza_done = django.dispatch.Signal()
```

This declares a `pizza_done` signal.

<a id="sending-signals"></a>

### Sending signals

There are two ways to send signals synchronously in Django.

#### Signal.send(sender, \*\*kwargs)

#### Signal.send_robust(sender, \*\*kwargs)

Signals may also be sent asynchronously.

#### Signal.asend(sender, \*\*kwargs)

#### Signal.asend_robust(sender, \*\*kwargs)

To send a signal, call either [`Signal.send()`](#django.dispatch.Signal.send), [`Signal.send_robust()`](#django.dispatch.Signal.send_robust),
[`await Signal.asend()`](#django.dispatch.Signal.asend), or
[`await Signal.asend_robust()`](#django.dispatch.Signal.asend_robust). You must provide the
`sender` argument (which is a class most of the time) and may provide as many
other keyword arguments as you like.

For example, here’s how sending our `pizza_done` signal might look:

```default
class PizzaStore:
    ...

    def send_pizza(self, toppings, size):
        pizza_done.send(sender=self.__class__, toppings=toppings, size=size)
        ...
```

All four methods return a list of tuple pairs `[(receiver, response), ...]`,
representing the list of called receiver functions and their response values.

`send()` differs from `send_robust()` in how exceptions raised by receiver
functions are handled. `send()` does *not* catch any exceptions raised by
receivers; it simply allows errors to propagate. Thus not all receivers may
be notified of a signal in the face of an error.

`send_robust()` catches all errors derived from Python’s `Exception` class,
and ensures all receivers are notified of the signal. If an error occurs, the
error instance is returned in the tuple pair for the receiver that raised the
error.

The tracebacks are present on the `__traceback__` attribute of the errors
returned when calling `send_robust()`.

`asend()` is similar to `send()`, but it is a coroutine that must be
awaited:

```default
async def asend_pizza(self, toppings, size):
    await pizza_done.asend(sender=self.__class__, toppings=toppings, size=size)
    ...
```

Whether synchronous or asynchronous, receivers will be correctly adapted to
whether `send()` or `asend()` is used. Synchronous receivers will be
called using [`sync_to_async()`](async.md#asgiref.sync.sync_to_async) when invoked via `asend()`. Asynchronous
receivers will be called using [`async_to_sync()`](async.md#asgiref.sync.async_to_sync) when invoked via
`send()`. Similar to the [case for middleware](async.md#async-performance),
there is a small performance cost to adapting receivers in this way. Note that
in order to reduce the number of sync/async calling-style switches within a
`send()` or `asend()` call, the receivers are grouped by whether or not
they are async before being called. This means that an asynchronous receiver
registered before a synchronous receiver may be executed after the synchronous
receiver. In addition, async receivers are executed concurrently using
[`asyncio.TaskGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.TaskGroup).

All built-in signals, except those in the async request-response cycle, are
dispatched using [`Signal.send()`](#django.dispatch.Signal.send).

#### Versionchanged
In older versions, async receivers were executed via `asyncio.gather()`.

## Disconnecting signals

#### Signal.disconnect(receiver=None, sender=None, dispatch_uid=None)

To disconnect a receiver from a signal, call [`Signal.disconnect()`](#django.dispatch.Signal.disconnect). The
arguments are as described in [`Signal.connect()`](#django.dispatch.Signal.connect). The method returns
`True` if a receiver was disconnected and `False` if not. When `sender`
is passed as a lazy reference to `<app label>.<model>`, this method always
returns `None`.

The `receiver` argument indicates the registered receiver to disconnect. It
may be `None` if `dispatch_uid` is used to identify the receiver.
