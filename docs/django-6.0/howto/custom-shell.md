# How to customize the `shell` command

The Django [`shell`](../ref/django-admin.md#django-admin-shell) is an interactive Python environment that provides
access to models and settings, making it useful for testing code, experimenting
with queries, and interacting with application data.

Customizing the [`shell`](../ref/django-admin.md#django-admin-shell) command allows adding extra functionality or
pre-loading specific modules. To do this, create a new management command that
subclasses `django.core.management.commands.shell.Command` and overrides the
existing `shell` management command. For more details, refer to the guide on
[overriding commands](custom-management-commands.md#overriding-commands).

## Customize automatic imports

To customize the automatic import behavior of the [`shell`](../ref/django-admin.md#django-admin-shell) management
command, override the `get_auto_imports()` method. This method should return
a sequence of import paths for objects or modules available in the application.
For example:

```python
from django.core.management.commands import shell


class Command(shell.Command):
    def get_auto_imports(self):
        return super().get_auto_imports() + [
            "django.urls.reverse",
            "django.urls.resolve",
        ]
```

The customization above adds [`resolve()`](../ref/urlresolvers.md#django.urls.resolve) and
[`reverse()`](../ref/urlresolvers.md#django.urls.reverse) to the default namespace, which already includes
all models from the apps listed in [`INSTALLED_APPS`](../ref/settings.md#std-setting-INSTALLED_APPS) plus what is
imported by default. These objects will be available in the `shell` without
requiring a manual import.

Running this customized `shell` command with `verbosity=2` would show:

```console
13 objects imported automatically:

  from django.db import connection, reset_queries, models
  from django.conf import settings
  from django.contrib.admin.models import LogEntry
  from django.contrib.auth.models import Group, Permission, User
  from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
  from django.contrib.sessions.models import Session
  from django.urls import resolve, reverse
  from django.utils import timezone
```

#### Versionchanged
Automatic imports of common utilities, such as `django.conf.settings`,
were added.

If an overridden `shell` command includes paths that cannot be imported,
these errors are shown when `verbosity` is set to `1` or higher. Duplicate
imports are automatically handled.

Note that automatic imports can be disabled for a specific `shell` session
using the [`--no-imports`](../ref/django-admin.md#cmdoption-shell-no-imports) flag. To permanently
disable automatic imports, override `get_auto_imports()` to return `None`:

```default
class Command(shell.Command):
    def get_auto_imports(self):
        return None
```
