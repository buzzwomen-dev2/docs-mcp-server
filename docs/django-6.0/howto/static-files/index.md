# How to manage static files (e.g. images, JavaScript, CSS)

Websites generally need to serve additional files such as images, JavaScript,
or CSS. In Django, we refer to these files as “static files”. Django provides
[`django.contrib.staticfiles`](../../ref/contrib/staticfiles.md#module-django.contrib.staticfiles) to help you manage them.

This page describes how you can serve these static files.

## Configuring static files

1. Make sure that `django.contrib.staticfiles` is included in your
   [`INSTALLED_APPS`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-INSTALLED_APPS).
2. In your settings file, define [`STATIC_URL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-STATIC_URL), for example:
   ```default
   STATIC_URL = "static/"
   ```
3. In your templates, use the [`static`](../../ref/templates/builtins.md#std-templatetag-static) template tag to build the URL for
   the given relative path using the configured `staticfiles`
   [`STORAGES`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-STORAGES) alias.

   ```html+django
   {% load static %}
   <img src="{% static 'my_app/example.jpg' %}" alt="My image">
   ```
4. Store your static files in a folder called `static` in your app. For
   example `my_app/static/my_app/example.jpg`.

Your project will probably also have static assets that aren’t tied to a
particular app. In addition to using a `static/` directory inside your apps,
you can define a list of directories ([`STATICFILES_DIRS`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-STATICFILES_DIRS)) in your
settings file where Django will also look for static files. For example:

```default
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / "static",
    "/var/www/static/",
]
```

See the documentation for the [`STATICFILES_FINDERS`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-STATICFILES_FINDERS) setting for
details on how `staticfiles` finds your files.

## Serving static files during development

If you use [`django.contrib.staticfiles`](../../ref/contrib/staticfiles.md#module-django.contrib.staticfiles) as explained above,
[`runserver`](../../ref/django-admin.md#django-admin-runserver) will do this automatically when [`DEBUG`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-DEBUG) is set
to `True`. If you don’t have `django.contrib.staticfiles` in
[`INSTALLED_APPS`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-INSTALLED_APPS), you can still manually serve static files using the
[`django.views.static.serve()`](../../ref/views.md#django.views.static.serve) view.

This is not suitable for production use! For some common deployment
strategies, see [How to deploy static files](deployment.md).

For example, if your [`STATIC_URL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-STATIC_URL) is defined as `static/`, you can
do this by adding the following snippet to your `urls.py`:

```default
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    # ... the rest of your URLconf goes here ...
] + static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)
```

#### NOTE
This helper function works only in debug mode and only if
the given prefix is local (e.g. `static/`) and not a URL (e.g.
`http://static.example.com/`).

Also this helper function only serves the actual [`STATIC_ROOT`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-STATIC_ROOT)
folder; it doesn’t perform static files discovery like
[`django.contrib.staticfiles`](../../ref/contrib/staticfiles.md#module-django.contrib.staticfiles).

Finally, static files are served via a wrapper at the WSGI application
layer. As a consequence, static files requests do not pass through the
normal [middleware chain](../../topics/http/middleware.md).

## Serving files uploaded by a user during development

During development, you can serve user-uploaded media files from
[`MEDIA_ROOT`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-MEDIA_ROOT) using the [`django.views.static.serve()`](../../ref/views.md#django.views.static.serve) view.

This is not suitable for production use! For some common deployment
strategies, see [How to deploy static files](deployment.md).

For example, if your [`MEDIA_URL`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-MEDIA_URL) is defined as `media/`, you can do
this by adding the following snippet to your [`ROOT_URLCONF`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-ROOT_URLCONF):

```default
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    # ... the rest of your URLconf goes here ...
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

#### NOTE
This helper function works only in debug mode and only if
the given prefix is local (e.g. `media/`) and not a URL (e.g.
`http://media.example.com/`).

## Testing

When running tests that use actual HTTP requests instead of the built-in
testing client (i.e. when using the built-in [`LiveServerTestCase`](../../topics/testing/tools.md#django.test.LiveServerTestCase)) the static assets need to be served along
the rest of the content so the test environment reproduces the real one as
faithfully as possible, but `LiveServerTestCase` has only very basic static
file-serving functionality: It doesn’t know about the finders feature of the
`staticfiles` application and assumes the static content has already been
collected under [`STATIC_ROOT`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-STATIC_ROOT).

Because of this, `staticfiles` ships its own
[`django.contrib.staticfiles.testing.StaticLiveServerTestCase`](../../ref/contrib/staticfiles.md#django.contrib.staticfiles.testing.StaticLiveServerTestCase), a
subclass of the built-in one that has the ability to transparently serve all
the assets during execution of these tests in a way very similar to what we get
at development time with `DEBUG = True`, i.e. without having to collect them
using [`collectstatic`](../../ref/contrib/staticfiles.md#django-admin-collectstatic) first.

## Deployment

[`django.contrib.staticfiles`](../../ref/contrib/staticfiles.md#module-django.contrib.staticfiles) provides a convenience management command
for gathering static files in a single directory so you can serve them easily.

1. Set the [`STATIC_ROOT`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-STATIC_ROOT) setting to the directory from which you’d
   like to serve these files, for example:
   ```default
   STATIC_ROOT = "/var/www/example.com/static/"
   ```
2. Run the [`collectstatic`](../../ref/contrib/staticfiles.md#django-admin-collectstatic) management command:
   ```shell
   $ python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

   This will copy all files from your static folders into the
   [`STATIC_ROOT`](../../ref/settings.md#std-setting-STATIC_ROOT) directory.
3. Use a web server of your choice to serve the
   files. [How to deploy static files](deployment.md) covers some common deployment
   strategies for static files.
