# Django 5.0.14 release notes

*April 2, 2025*

Django 5.0.14 fixes a security issue with severity “moderate” in 5.0.13.

## CVE-2025-27556: Potential denial-of-service vulnerability in `LoginView`, `LogoutView`, and `set_language()` on Windows

Python’s [`NFKC normalization`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html#unicodedata.normalize) is slow on
Windows. As a consequence, [`LoginView`](../topics/auth/default.md#django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView),
[`LogoutView`](../topics/auth/default.md#django.contrib.auth.views.LogoutView), and
[`set_language()`](../topics/i18n/translation.md#django.views.i18n.set_language) were subject to a potential
denial-of-service attack via certain inputs with a very large number of Unicode
characters.
