# Django 5.0.3 release notes

*March 4, 2024*

Django 5.0.3 fixes a security issue with severity “moderate” and several bugs
in 5.0.2.

## CVE-2024-27351: Potential regular expression denial-of-service in `django.utils.text.Truncator.words()`

`django.utils.text.Truncator.words()` method (with `html=True`) and
[`truncatewords_html`](../ref/templates/builtins.md#std-templatefilter-truncatewords_html) template filter were subject to a potential
regular expression denial-of-service attack using a suitably crafted string
(follow up to [**CVE 2019-14232**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-14232) and [**CVE 2023-43665**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-43665)).

## Bugfixes

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0.2 where `intcomma` template filter could
  return a leading comma for string representation of floats ([#35172](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35172)).
* Fixed a bug in Django 5.0 that caused a crash of `Signal.asend()` and
  `asend_robust()` when all receivers were asynchronous functions
  ([#35174](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35174)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0.1 where [`ModelAdmin.lookup_allowed()`](../ref/contrib/admin/index.md#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.lookup_allowed)
  would prevent filtering against foreign keys using lookups like `__isnull`
  when the field was not included in [`ModelAdmin.list_filter`](../ref/contrib/admin/index.md#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_filter)
  ([#35173](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35173)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 that caused a crash of
  `@sensitive_variables` and `@sensitive_post_parameters` decorators on
  functions loaded from `.pyc` files ([#35187](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35187)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 that caused a crash when reloading a test
  database and a base queryset for a base manager used `prefetch_related()`
  ([#35238](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35238)).
* Fixed a bug in Django 5.0 where facet filters in the admin would crash on a
  `SimpleListFilter` using a queryset without primary keys ([#35198](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35198)).
