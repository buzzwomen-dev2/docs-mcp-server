# Django 1.7.2 release notes

*January 2, 2015*

Django 1.7.2 fixes several bugs in 1.7.1.

Additionally, Django’s vendored version of six, `django.utils.six`, has
been upgraded to the latest release (1.9.0).

## Bugfixes

* Fixed migration’s renaming of auto-created many-to-many tables when changing
  [`Meta.db_table`](../ref/models/options.md#django.db.models.Options.db_table) ([#23630](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23630)).
* Fixed a migration crash when adding an explicit `id` field to a model on
  SQLite ([#23702](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23702)).

  `RuntimeError` was raised every time two models clashed in the app
  registry. ([#23621](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23621)).
* Prevented [`flush`](../ref/django-admin.md#django-admin-flush) from loading initial data for migrated apps
  ([#23699](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23699)).
* Fixed a [`makemessages`](../ref/django-admin.md#django-admin-makemessages) regression in 1.7.1 when
  [`STATIC_ROOT`](../ref/settings.md#std-setting-STATIC_ROOT) has the default `None` value ([#23717](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23717)).
* Added GeoDjango compatibility with mysqlclient database driver.

  ([#23719](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23719)).
* Fixed a migration crash when removing a field that is referenced in
  `AlterIndexTogether` or `AlterUniqueTogether` ([#23614](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23614)).
* Updated the first day of the week in the Ukrainian locale to Monday.
* Added support for transactional spatial metadata initialization on
  SpatiaLite 4.1+ ([#23152](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23152)).
* Fixed a migration crash that prevented changing a nullable field with a
  default to non-nullable with the same default ([#23738](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23738)).
* Fixed a migration crash when adding `GeometryField`s with `blank=True`
  on PostGIS ([#23731](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23731)).
* Allowed usage of `DateTimeField()` as `Transform.output_field`
  ([#23420](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23420)).
* Fixed a migration serializing bug involving `float("nan")` and
  `float("inf")` ([#23770](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23770)).

  but no `limit_choices_to` could not be used in a
  [`ModelForm`](../topics/forms/modelforms.md#django.forms.ModelForm) ([#23795](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23795)).
* Fixed a custom field type validation error with MySQL backend when
  `db_type` returned `None` ([#23761](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23761)).

  ([#23799](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23799)).
* Made [`RenameModel`](../ref/migration-operations.md#django.db.migrations.operations.RenameModel) reversible
  ([#22248](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/22248))
* Avoided unnecessary rollbacks of migrations from other apps when migrating
  backwards ([#23410](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23410)).
* Fixed a rare query error when using deeply nested subqueries
  ([#23605](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23605)).
* Fixed a crash in migrations when deleting a field that is part of a
  `index/unique_together` constraint ([#23794](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23794)).
* Fixed `django.core.files.File.__repr__()` when the file’s `name` contains
  Unicode characters ([#23888](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23888)).
* Added missing context to the admin’s `delete_selected` view that prevented
  custom site header, etc. from appearing ([#23898](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23898)).
* Fixed a regression with dynamically generated inlines and allowed field
  references in the admin ([#23754](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23754)).
* Fixed an infinite loop bug for certain cyclic migration dependencies, and
  made the error message for cyclic dependencies much more helpful.
* Added missing `index_together` handling for SQLite ([#23880](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23880)).
* Fixed a crash when `RunSQL` SQL content was collected by the schema editor,
  typically when using `sqlmigrate` ([#23909](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23909)).
* Fixed a regression in `contrib.admin` add/change views which caused some
  `ModelAdmin` methods to receive the incorrect `obj` value
  ([#23934](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23934)).
* Fixed `runserver` crash when socket error message contained Unicode
  characters ([#23946](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23946)).
* Fixed serialization of `type` when adding a `deconstruct()` method
  ([#23950](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23950)).
* Prevented the
  `django.contrib.auth.middleware.SessionAuthenticationMiddleware` from
  setting a `"Vary: Cookie"` header on all responses ([#23939](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23939)).
* Fixed a crash when adding `blank=True` to `TextField()` on MySQL
  ([#23920](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23920)).
* Fixed index creation by the migration infrastructure, particularly when
  dealing with PostgreSQL specific `{text|varchar}_pattern_ops` indexes
  ([#23954](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23954)).
* Fixed bug in `makemigrations` that created broken migration files when
  dealing with multiple table inheritance and inheriting from more than one
  model ([#23956](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23956)).
* Fixed a crash when a `MultiValueField` has invalid data ([#23674](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23674)).
* Fixed a crash in the admin when using “Save as new” and also deleting a
  related inline ([#23857](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23857)).
* Always converted `related_name` to text (Unicode), since that is required
  on Python 3 for interpolation. Removed conversion of `related_name` to text
  in migration deconstruction ([#23455](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23455) and [#23982](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23982)).
* Enlarged the sizes of tablespaces which are created by default for testing
  on Oracle (the main tablespace was increased from 200M to 300M and the
  temporary tablespace from 100M to 150M). This was required to accommodate
  growth in Django’s own test suite ([#23969](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23969)).
* Fixed `timesince` filter translations in Korean ([#23989](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23989)).
* Fixed the SQLite `SchemaEditor` to properly add defaults in the absence of
  a user specified `default`. For example, a `CharField` with
  `blank=True` didn’t set existing rows to an empty string which resulted in
  a crash when adding the `NOT NULL` constraint ([#23987](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23987)).
* `makemigrations` no longer prompts for a default value when adding
  `TextField()` or `CharField()` without a `default` ([#23405](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23405)).
* Fixed a migration crash when adding `order_with_respect_to` to a table
  with existing rows ([#23983](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23983)).
* Restored the `pre_migrate` signal if all apps have migrations
  ([#23975](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23975)).
* Made admin system checks run for custom `AdminSite`s ([#23497](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23497)).
* Ensured the app registry is fully populated when unpickling models. When an
  external script (like a queueing infrastructure) reloads pickled models, it
  could crash with an `AppRegistryNotReady` exception ([#24007](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24007)).
* Added quoting to field indexes in the SQL generated by migrations to prevent
  a crash when the index name requires it ([#24015](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24015)).
* Added `datetime.time` support to migrations questioner ([#23998](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23998)).
* Fixed admindocs crash on apps installed as eggs ([#23525](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23525)).
* Changed migrations autodetector to generate an `AlterModelOptions`
  operation instead of `DeleteModel` and `CreateModel` operations when
  changing `Meta.managed`. This prevents data loss when changing `managed`
  from `False` to `True` and vice versa ([#24037](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24037)).
* Enabled the `sqlsequencereset` command on apps with migrations
  ([#24054](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24054)).
* Added tablespace SQL to apps with migrations ([#24051](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24051)).
* Corrected `contrib.sites` default site creation in a multiple database
  setup ([#24000](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24000)).
* Restored support for objects that aren’t [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) or [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes) in
  `django.utils.safestring.mark_for_escaping()` on Python 3.
* Supported strings escaped by third-party libraries with the `__html__`
  convention in the template engine ([#23831](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23831)).
* Prevented extraneous `DROP DEFAULT` SQL in migrations ([#23581](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23581)).
* Restored the ability to use more than five levels of subqueries
  ([#23758](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23758)).
* Fixed crash when `ValidationError` is initialized with a
  `ValidationError` that is initialized with a dictionary ([#24008](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24008)).
* Prevented a crash on apps without migrations when running `migrate --list`
  ([#23366](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23366)).
