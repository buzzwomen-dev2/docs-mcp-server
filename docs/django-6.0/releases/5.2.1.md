# Django 5.2.1 release notes

*May 7, 2025*

Django 5.2.1 fixes a security issue with severity “moderate” and several bugs
in 5.2.

This release was built using an upgraded [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/), producing
filenames compliant with [**PEP 491**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0491/) and [**PEP 625**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0625/) and thus addressing a PyPI
warning about non-compliant distribution filenames. This change only affects
the Django packaging process and does not impact Django’s behavior.

## CVE-2025-32873: Denial-of-service possibility in `strip_tags()`

[`strip_tags()`](../ref/utils.md#django.utils.html.strip_tags) would be slow to evaluate certain inputs
containing large sequences of incomplete HTML tags. This function is used to
implement the [`striptags`](../ref/templates/builtins.md#std-templatefilter-striptags) template filter, which was thus also
vulnerable.

[`strip_tags()`](../ref/utils.md#django.utils.html.strip_tags) now raises a [`SuspiciousOperation`](../ref/exceptions.md#django.core.exceptions.SuspiciousOperation)
exception if it encounters an unusually large number of unclosed opening tags.

## Bugfixes

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.2 that caused a crash when annotating
  aggregate expressions over query that uses explicit grouping by transforms
  followed by field references ([#36292](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36292)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 5.2 that caused unnecessary queries when
  prefetching nullable foreign key relationships ([#36290](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36290)).

  selected when using `QuerySet.alias()` after `values()`
  ([#36299](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36299)).
* Fixed a data corruption possibility in `file_move_safe()` when
  `allow_overwrite=True`, where leftover content from a previously larger
  file could remain after overwriting with a smaller one due to lack of
  truncation ([#36298](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36298)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 5.2 that caused a crash when using
  `QuerySet.select_for_update(of=(…))` with `values()/values_list()`
  including expressions ([#36301](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36301)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 5.2 that caused improper values to be returned
  from `QuerySet.values_list()` when duplicate field names were specified
  ([#36288](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36288)).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.2, introduced when fixing [**CVE 2025-26699**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-26699),

  between paragraphs after wrapping text ([#36341](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36341)).

  alternatives or attachments due to named tuple mismatches ([#36309](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36309)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 5.2 that caused a crash when using `update()`
  on a `QuerySet` filtered against a related model and including references
  to annotations through `values()` ([#36360](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36360)).
* Fixed a bug in Django 5.2 that caused composite primary key introspection to
  wrongly identify `IntegerField` as `AutoField` on SQLite
  ([#36358](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36358)).
* Fixed a bug in Django 5.2 that caused a redundant `unique_together`
  constraint to be generated for composite primary keys when using
  [`inspectdb`](../ref/django-admin.md#django-admin-inspectdb) ([#36357](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36357)).
