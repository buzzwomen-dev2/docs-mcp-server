# Django 5.1.7 release notes

*March 6, 2025*

Django 5.1.7 fixes a security issue with severity “moderate” and several bugs
in 5.1.6.

## CVE-2025-26699: Potential denial-of-service vulnerability in `django.utils.text.wrap()`

The `wrap()` and [`wordwrap`](../ref/templates/builtins.md#std-templatefilter-wordwrap) template filter were subject to a
potential denial-of-service attack when used with very long strings.

## Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug in Django 5.1 where the `{% querystring %}` template tag
  returned an empty string rather than `"?"` when all parameters had been
  removed from the query string ([#36182](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36182)).
* Fixed a bug in Django 5.1 where `FileSystemStorage`, with
  `allow_overwrite` set to `True`, did not truncate the overwritten file
  content ([#36191](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36191)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 5.1 where the `count` and `exists` methods
  of `ManyToManyField` related managers would always return `0` and
  `False` when the intermediary model back references used `to_field`
  ([#36197](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36197)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 5.1 where the `pre_save` and `post_save`
  signals for `LogEntry` were not sent when deleting a single object in the
  admin ([#36217](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36217)).
