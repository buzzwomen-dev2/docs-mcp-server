# Django 1.9.5 release notes

*April 1, 2016*

Django 1.9.5 fixes several bugs in 1.9.4.

## Bugfixes

* Made `MultiPartParser` ignore filenames that normalize to an empty string
  to fix crash in `MemoryFileUploadHandler` on specially crafted user input
  ([#26325](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/26325)).
* Fixed a race condition in `BaseCache.get_or_set()` ([#26332](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/26332)). It
  now returns the `default` value instead of `False` if there’s an error
  when trying to add the value to the cache.
* Fixed data loss on SQLite where `DurationField` values with fractional
  seconds could be saved as `None` ([#26324](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/26324)).
* The forms in `contrib.auth` no longer strip trailing and leading whitespace
  from the password fields ([#26334](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/26334)). The change requires users who set
  their password to something with such whitespace after a site updated to
  Django 1.9 to reset their password. It provides backwards-compatibility for
  earlier versions of Django.
* Fixed a memory leak in the cached template loader ([#26306](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/26306)).
* Fixed a regression that caused `collectstatic --clear` to fail if the
  storage doesn’t implement `path()` ([#26297](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/26297)).
* Fixed a crash when using a reverse lookup with a subquery when a
  `ForeignKey` has a `to_field` set to something other than the primary key
  ([#26373](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/26373)).
* Fixed a regression in `CommonMiddleware` that caused spurious warnings in
  logs on requests missing a trailing slash ([#26293](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/26293)).
* Restored the functionality of the admin’s `raw_id_fields` in
  `list_editable` ([#26387](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/26387)).
* Fixed a regression with abstract model inheritance and explicit parent links
  ([#26413](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/26413)).
* Fixed a migrations crash on SQLite when renaming the primary key of a model
  containing a `ForeignKey` to `'self'` ([#26384](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/26384)).
* Fixed `JSONField` inadvertently escaping its contents when displaying
  values after failed form validation ([#25532](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25532)).
