# Django 4.2.23 release notes

*June 10, 2025*

Django 4.2.23 fixes a potential log injection issue in 4.2.22.

## Bugfixes

* Fixed a log injection possibility by migrating remaining response logging
  to `django.utils.log.log_response()`, which safely escapes arguments such
  as the request path to prevent unsafe log output ([**CVE 2025-48432**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48432)).
